\chapter{Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy}
%======================================================================
\comment{SUPERNOTE: Make sure it's clear that I only did the VB EE part, not the DMRG/vN part.}

In \change{year that this happened} a new quantity called {\it{valence bond entanglement entropy}} (\vb) was proposed by \change{Fabian and co, also affleck or something?}.  
This quantity seems to have properties similar to the von Neumann entanglement entropy (\vn).
The main \change{draw, advantage} of \vb is its \change{easy to measure -ableness,
ease of measurement?} when working in the valence bond basis.
For a valence bond basis state \vb between two regions, A and B, is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\VB_A = \ln({2})\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}},
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}}$ is the number of valence bonds crossing the boundary between
regions A and B.
\comment{Add in a figure showing this!!}


\vb shares some properties with \vn; in particular, for both quantities: $S_{\text{A}} = S_{\text{B}}$.
Also, $\VB = 0$ for systems with no entanglement between regions A and B.
For any single valence bond basis state \vb and \vn agree exactly, and
in one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems, \vb seems to to be in good agreement with
the conformal field theory (CFT) results for \vn.
However, in two dimensions \vb shows a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law
for the isotropic Heisenberg model.  
Ground states of unfrustrated 2D spin-1/2 systems with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions
are expected to follow an area law \comment {reference that paper (eisert)}, though for the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model the entanglement entropy had not yet been studied \change{explicitly}.


To \change{study/examine?} \change{this quantity} and check its \change{correspondence} to a known measure of entanglement we place our \vb data alongside measurements of \vn
on the same system, calculated with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations by I. Gonzalez and R. Melko.
\vb is calculated using valence bond quantum Monte Carlo (VB QMC) simulations.

In 1D we fit the entanglement entropy results to the analytical results from CFT...}

\section{One Dimensional Systems}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\change{We begin by simulating one dimensional systems, examining both the cases of
open and periodic boundary conditions.}
\notsay{The DMRG simulations require both of regions A and B to be topologically connected, so 
the same \change{convention} is used in the VB QMC simulations.}

It is convenient to denote the size of region A by the number of sites included in that region 
(i.e. for a 1D system of length $L$, $S_{\text{A}} = S(x)$ is the entanglement entropy for a system where region A contains sites $\{1,2,\dots,x\}$ and the rest of the sites $\{x+1,x+2,\dots,L\}$
belong to region B.

As mentioned in section \ref{1dcft}, for a 1D critical system the scaling of the entanglement entropy is described by CFT results as in Eq.~\eqref{cft1d}.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1dPBC} shows the \vb measurements for a periodic spin chain with 100 sites, plotted alongside \vn data.  \vb seems to fit well to the CFT result, though it is lower than \vn.
Linear regression fits of the \vb and \vn data for several system sizes (Figure~\ref{c1}) shows $c^{\rm vN}$ approaching 1 as the system size increases, however $c^{\rm VB}$ gives a lower value of $c$.

\end{figure}

\change{For the OBC case} (Figure~\ref{1dOBC}), we see entanglement entropies split into two branches, where the upper branch corresponds to an odd number of sites in region A, and the lower to an even number.
\change{This branching is due to a ``dimerization" effect caused by the open boundary conditions \cite{Ian1}.}
In contrast to the PBC case, \vb is now higher than \vn.
