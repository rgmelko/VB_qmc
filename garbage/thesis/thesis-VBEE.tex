\chapter{Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy}
%======================================================================
\comment{SUPERNOTE: Make sure it's clear that I only did the VB EE part, not the DMRG/vN part.}

In \change{year that this happened} a new quantity called {\it{valence bond entanglement entropy}} ($\vb$) which seems to have properties
similar to entanglement entropy was proposed by \change{Fabian and co, also affleck or something?}.  
The main \change{draw, advantage} of this quantity is its \change{easy to measure -ableness,
ease of measurement?} when working in the valence bond basis.
For a valence bond basis state $\vb$ between two regions, A and B, is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\vb_A = \ln({2})\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}},
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}}$ is the number of valence bonds crossing the boundary between
regions A and B.
\comment{Add in a figure showing this!!}


$\vb$ shares some properties with $\vn$; in particular, for both quantities: $S_{\text{A}} = S_{\text{B}}$.
Also, $\vb = 0$ for systems with no entanglement between regions A and B.
For any single valence bond basis state $\vb$ and $\vn$ agree exactly, and
in one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems, $\vb$ seems to to be in good agreement with
the conformal field theory (CFT) results for $\vn$.
However, in two dimensions $\vb$ shows a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law
for the isotropic Heisenberg model.  
Ground states of unfrustrated 2D spin-1/2 systems with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions
are expected to follow an area law \comment {reference that paper (eisert)}, though for the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model the entanglement entropy had not yet been studied \change{explicitly}.


To \change{study/examine?} \change{this quantity} and check its \change{correspondence} to a known measure of entanglement we place our $\vb$ data alongside measurements of $\vn$
on the same system, calculated with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. \comment{somehow say it wasn't done by me.} 
$\vb$ is calculated using valence bond quantum Monte Carlo (VB QMC) simulations.

In 1D we fit the entanglement entropy results to the analytical results from CFT...}

\section{One Dimensional Systems}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\change{We begin by simulating one dimensional systems, examining both the cases of
open and periodic boundary conditions.}
The DMRG simulations require both of regions A and B to be topologically connected, and the 
same \change{convention} is used in the VB QMC simulations.

It is convenient to denote the size of region A by the number of sites included in that region 
(i.e. for a 1D system of length $L$, $S_{\text{A}} = S(x)$ is the entanglement entropy for a system where region A contains sites $\{1,2,\dots,x\}$ and the rest of the sites $\{x+1,x+2,\dots,L\}$
belong to region B.
