\chapter{Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy}
%======================================================================
\comment{SUPERNOTE: Make sure it's clear that I only did the VB EE part, not the DMRG/vN part.}

Recently a new quantity called {\it{valence bond entanglement entropy}} (\vB) was proposed \cite{Ian1, Alet, Chh},  
which seems to have properties similar to the von Neumann entanglement entropy (\vN).
The main advantage of \vb the simplicity of its measurement when working in the valence bond basis.
For a valence bond basis state \vb between two regions, A and B, it is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\VB_A = \ln({2})\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}},
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}}$ is the number of valence bonds crossing the boundary between
regions A and B.
\comment{Add in a figure showing this!!}


\vb shares some properties with \vN; in particular, for both quantities: $S_{\text{A}} = S_{\text{B}}$.
Also, $\VB = 0$ for systems with no entanglement between regions A and B.
For any single valence bond basis state \vb and \vn agree exactly, and
in one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems, \vb seems to to be in good agreement with
results from conformal field theory (CFT) for \vN.
However, in two dimensions \vb shows a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law
for the isotropic Heisenberg model.  
Ground states of unfrustrated 2D spin-1/2 systems with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions
are expected to follow an area law \comment {reference that paper (eisert)}, though for the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model the entanglement entropy had not yet been studied \change{explicitly}.


To \change{study/examine?} \change{this quantity} and check its \change{correspondence} to a known measure of entanglement we place our \vb data alongside measurements of \vn
on the same system, calculated with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations by I. Gonzalez and R. Melko.
\vb is calculated using a single projector valence bond quantum Monte Carlo (VB QMC) scheme.

\section{One Dimensional Systems}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\change{We begin by simulating one dimensional systems, examining both the cases of
open and periodic boundary conditions.}
\notsay{The DMRG simulations require both of regions A and B to be topologically connected, so 
the same \change{convention} is used in the VB QMC simulations.}

It is convenient to denote the size of region A by the number of sites included in that region 
(i.e. for a 1D system of length $L$, $S_{\text{A}} = S(x)$ is the entanglement entropy for a system where region A contains sites $\{1,2,\dots,x\}$ and the rest of the sites $\{x+1,x+2,\dots,L\}$
belong to region B.

As mentioned in section \ref{1dcft}, for a 1D critical system the scaling of the entanglement entropy is described by Eq.~\eqref{cft1d}.

\label{1dPBC}}
} 
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{1dPBC} shows the \vb measurements for a periodic spin chain of length $L=100$ sites, plotted alongside \vn data.  \vb seems to fit well to the CFT result, though it is lower than \vN.
We use linear regression to fit the \vb and \vn data for several system sizes to $S_{\rm PBC}^{\rm vN}$ from Eq. \eqref{cft1d}. Figure~\ref{c1} shows $c^{\rm vN}$ approaching 1 (the expected value for this system \comment{REFERENCE}) as the system size increases, however $c^{\rm VB}$ seems to approach a lower value.

	\label{1dOBC}}}
\end{figure}

For the OBC case (Figure~\ref{1dOBC}), we see both \vn and \vb split into two branches, where the upper branch corresponds to an odd number of sites in region A, and the lower to an even number.
This branching is due to a ``dimerization" effect caused by the open boundary conditions \cite{Ian1}.
In contrast to the PBC case, \vb is now higher than \vN{} implying that, unlike the successive Renyi entropies \comment{eqref}, \vb does not give a bound on \vn.
Figure \ref{c2} shows the linear regression fits of the lower branch of OBC data for several different system sizes to $\VN_{\text{OBC}}$ from Equation \eqref{cft1d}.  As the number of points included is decreased (until we are only using data where the division between regions A and B is ``far'' from the open boundaries of the system) we see $c^{\rm vN}$ approach a constant value for all system sizes.  As the system size increases $c^{\rm vN}$ approaches the expected value \comment{REF} of 1.  On the other hand, from the $S^{\rm VB}$ data, it is not clear whether $c^{\rm VB}$ approaches a constant value for large system sizes.  We see only that $c^{\rm VB}$ is lower than the expected value of 1, and that it is lower than the $c^{\rm VB}$ value given by the PBC data.

 \end{figure}
 
 We now move towards two dimensions by adding ``legs" to our one dimensional OBC chains.
 Due to the constraints imposed by the DMRG on the geometry of region A the sites must be arranged in a snaking pattern (Fig \ref{laddersnake}).
The DMRG data, to which we compare \vB, are limited to ladders with $M=7$ legs because of the \change{poor scaling of the algorithm when approaching 2D}.
 The VB QMC algorithm \change{scales as $N^2$} for a system with N sites, so \change{ we measure up to $M=20$ with minimal CPU effort}.
 
 Figures \ref{ladder3} and \ref{ladder4} show the entanglement entropies for three- and four-leg ladders respectively.
 As with the 1D OBC spin chain, $\VB > \VN$ for these $M$-leg ladders.
 The entanglement entropies show different behavior depending on whether the number of legs is even or odd.
 Odd-leg ladders \notsay{are gapless, so all sites contribute to the entanglement, and so}
 $S(x) \propto \ln(x')$ as in the 1D case.
 \comment{Say something about the ``spin gap"! White, Noack, Scalapino, 1994.}
 Even-leg ladders \notsay{have a spin gap \comment{(white 1994)}} and so only sites within the correlation length $\xi$ from the boundary between A and B contribute to the entanglement,
so for even-leg ladders $S(x\gtrsim\xi) = \text{const}$.
Both even- and odd-leg ladders split into branches, as shown in the figure insets, though the even-leg ladders have a \change{pattern} with period $M$ whereas the odd-leg ladder entanglement entropies have a period of $2M$.  
 
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Area Law}
\label{vbAlaw}

Using these multileg ladders we can examine the adherence of the ground state of the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model to the area law.
To do this we use $M$-leg ladders, including $2M^2$ sites within region A.  
This ensures that the boundary between regions A and B cuts cleanly across all the legs of the system so that the length of the boundary is proportional to $M$, while also keeping keeping the divide between the two regions far enough from the open boundaries of the system to avoid boundary effects.
Additionally, the 2:1 aspect ratio ensures that, even for odd-leg ladders, an even number of sites is included in region A, reducing the odd-even oscillations in the entanglement entropies.

In Figure \ref{zigzag} we plot the entanglement entropies $S(x)/M$ versus M, for $M$-leg ladders,  on a logarithmic scale.
If the scaling of the entanglement entropy follows an area law we should see $S(x)/M$ approach a constant value for large $M$.
We include both systems with 100 sites per leg, and systems with $4M$ sites per leg. 
In the second case the size of region A is proportional to the size of the ladder, and the divide between regions A and B is always cutting the ladder through the middle.

We observe a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law in \vB, as previously shown by Refs.\cite{Alet,Chh}.
This correction, however, is not present in the \vn results from DMRG.
\vn convincingly approaches a constant value for large $M$, suggesting that the area law is valid for \vn in the $M \rightarrow \infty$ limit. 
These results also imply that the multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law is present only in \vB, and not necessarily in all measures of entropy.

(with length proportional to the number of legs) are shown.
For large $M$, $S^{\rm VB}\propto M \ln M$,
whereas $S^{\rm vN}\propto M$.

\section{Bond Length Distribution}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can relate \vb to the bond length distribution $P(x,y)$, defined by Sandvik as the probability of finding a bond between sites $x$ and $y$. 
 Sandvik found that for $P(x,y) \sim \lvert x-y \rvert^{-p}$ with $p \approx 3$ for the \change{2D Heisenberg ground state / N\'eel state}.
It is possible to relate \vb to the bond length distribution as
\begin{equation}
\VB_{\text{A}} = \sum_{x\in \text{A}}\sum_{y\in \text{B}} P(x,y) \ln{(2)}.
\end{equation}

\section{Analytical Calculations}

%\comment{
%There are \change{two} reasons why \vb fails to properly measure entanglement.
%First, linear combinations of valence bond states are not properly normalized, and second, it is possible to have entanglement between two regions even when no valence bond crosses between those regions.

 \label{example1}

\end{figure}

From the 1D results (Figs.~\ref{1dOBC} and \ref{1dPBC}) we saw that \vb can be either greater or less than \vN.
This can be understood through some simple examples, shown in figures \ref{example1} and \ref{example2}.
The first example, Fig. \ref{example1} is an equal superposition of two four-site valence bond states. 
 \vb is easily calculated as maximal the maximal $\VB = 2\ln(2)$, since there are four bonds cross between regions A and B, but we divide by the number of states we have examined (two in this case).
 \change{This corresponds to the way \vb would be measured in the single projector VB QMC algorithm.}
 For such a small system, it is not difficult to calculate \vn explicitly, and we will do so here.
 We begin by writing out and normalizing the wavefunction in the $S^z$ basis.
 \begin{align}
\hspace{-2mm}
 \ket{\psi} &= C \big[ \left( \ket{\up_1\dw_2} - \ket{\dw_1\up_2}\right) \otimes 
 		\left( \ket{\up_3\dw_4} - \ket{\dw_3\up_4}\right) + 
		\left( \ket{\up_1\dw_4} - \ket{\dw_1\up_4}\right) \otimes 
 		\left( \ket{\up_3\dw_2} - \ket{\dw_3\up_2}\right) \big] \\
		&= C \big[ 2\ket{\up\dw\up\dw} + 2 \ket{\dw\up\dw\up} -
			\ket{\up\dw\dw\up} -\ket{\dw\up\up\dw} - \ket{\up\up\dw\dw} - \ket{\dw\dw\up\up}
			\big] \label{yknow}\\
C &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bra{\psi}\psi\rangle}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4+4+1+1+1+1}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}
 \end{align}
 Note that in \eqref{yknow} the spins are in numerical order $\ket{1,2,3,4}$.
 To simplify the process of finding the reduced density matrix $\rho_{\rm A}$ we relabel the states such that
 \begin{eqnarray}
 \ket{\up\up} \rightarrow \ket{a} \hspace{15mm} \ket{\up\dw} \rightarrow \ket{b}  \hspace{15mm} 
 \ket{\dw\up} \rightarrow \ket{c}  \hspace{15mm} \ket{\dw\dw} \rightarrow \ket{d},
 \end{eqnarray}
and a subscript A specifies that the state belongs spins 1 and 3, B refers to spins 2 and 4. 
 \begin{eqnarray}
\ket{\psi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} \big[ 
		2\ket{a}_{\rm A}\otimes \ket{d}_{\rm B} + 
		2\ket{d}_{\rm A}\otimes \ket{a}_{\rm B} 
		- \big(\ket{b} +\ket{c}\big)_{\rm A} \otimes  \ket{c}_{\rm B} 
		 -\big(\ket{c} +\ket{b}\big)_{\rm A} \otimes \ket{b}_{\rm B}
		\big]
 \end{eqnarray}
 When we trace out region B, only the terms that are diagonal in region B will survive. 
  We can avoid writing out the full density matrix and skip straight to the reduced density matrix.
  Now all the states refer to region A, spins 1 and 3.
  \begin{align}
\rho_{\rm A} &=  {\rm Tr_B} \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi} \\ 
		&= \frac{1}{12} \big[ 
		4\ket{a} \bra{a} + 4 \ket{d}\bra{d}
		+ 2\big(\ket{b} +\ket{c}\big)\big(\bra{b} +\bra{c}\big)
		\big] =
		\frac{1}{6}
		\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
		2 & 0&0&0\\
		0& 1& 1&0\\
		0& 1& 1&0\\
		0& 0& 0&2
		\end{array} \right]
 \end{align}
Diagonalizing $\rho_{\rm A}$ gives three identical eigenvalues of $\tfrac{1}{3}$, which we use to calculate \vN,
\begin{align}
\VN_{\rm A} = - {\rm Tr} \left(\rho_{\rm A} \ln \rho_{\rm A} \right)= -3\left( \frac{1}{3} \ln \left( \frac{1}{3}\right)\right)
		= \ln(3) \approx 1.0986.
\end{align}
For this system (Fig.~\ref{example1}) $\VB =2\ln(2) > \VN \approx 1.0986$.
Though $\VB=\VN$ for valence bond basis states, \vb does not give the correct result for some linear combinations of states.  
The \vb measurement does not even properly normalize the state in Fig. \ref{example1}.
In Figure \ref{example2} we have another linear combination of states, this time a superposition of two eight-site states, where region A includes the four sites on the left-hand side.  In this case we find that \vb underestimates \vn since there are no valence bonds crossing between regions A and B, but the two regions are still entangled.  The calculation of \vn for this state can be seen in Appendix~\ref{small}, where we find $\VN\approx 0.3251$.
