\chapter{Valence Bond Entanglement Entropy}
%======================================================================
\comment{SUPERNOTE: Make sure it's clear that I only did the VB EE part, not the DMRG/vN part.}

In \change{year that this happened} a new quantity called {\it{valence bond entanglement entropy}} ($\vb$) which seems to have properties
similar to entanglement entropy was proposed by \change{Fabian and co, also affleck or something?}.  
The main \change{draw, advantage} of this quantity is its \change{easy to measure -ableness,
ease of measurement?} when working in the valence bond basis.
For a valence bond basis state $\vb$ between two regions, A and B, is defined as 
\begin{equation}
\vb_A = \ln({2})\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}},
\end{equation} 
where $\mathcal{N}_{\text{A}}$ is the number of valence bonds crossing the boundary between
regions A and B.
\comment{Add in a figure showing this!!}


$\vb$ shares some properties with $\vn$; in particular, for both quantities: $S_{\text{A}} = S_{\text{B}}$.
Also, $\vb = 0$ for systems with no entanglement between regions A and B.
For any single valence bond basis state $\vb$ and $\vn$ agree exactly, and
in one-dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems, $\vb$ seems to to be in good agreement with
the conformal field theory (CFT) results for $\vn$.
However, in two dimensions $\vb$ shows a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law
for the isotropic Heisenberg model.  
Ground states of unfrustrated 2D spin-1/2 systems with exclusively nearest-neighbour interactions
are expected to follow an area law \comment {reference that paper (eisert)}, though for the 2D isotropic Heisenberg model the entanglement entropy had not yet been studied \change{explicitly}.


To \change{study/examine?} \change{this quantity} and check its \change{correspondence} to a known measure of entanglement we directly compare $\vb$ and $\vn$, where $\vb$ is calculated
using quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the valence bond basis, and $\vn$ is calculated with
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations.

In 1D we fit the entanglement entropy results to the analytical results from CFT...}

Entanglement entropies for a 1D Heisenberg chain with PBC and OBC. Upper
panels show the entropies as a function of the conformal distance $x'  = (L/\pi)\sin (\pi x/L)$ for
100-site chains.  Lower plots show the central
charge $c$, obtained by fitting the numerical data to the CFT result, for
several $L$.  For PBC, $c$ is calculated with the two smallest $x'$ points
removed.  For OBC, the fits depend on the number of sites included, $z$,
which we systematically decrease by removing $x'$ data points from the
{\it outside} ends of the chain.  $c$ is shown for $S^{\rm vN}$
(closed symbols) and $S^{\rm VB}$ (open symbols) for system sizes $L=64$
(circles), $L=100$ (squares), $L=128$ (diamonds), and $L=200$ (triangles)

(filled symbols) and free-fermion (open diamonds) ladders, taken such that
the region A includes $2N^2$ sites.  
For the Heisenberg model and large $N$, $S^{\rm VB}\propto N \ln N$,
whereas $S^{\rm vN}\propto N$.  
Data for free fermions, $S^{\rm vN}_{\rm ff}\propto N \ln N$,  are shown for comparison.
We show data for ladders with length (sites per leg) $L =100$ and
%ladders with length proportional to the number of legs 
$L=4N$.
