\begin{center}\textbf{Abstract}\end{center}

In this thesis we examine methods for measuring entanglement entropy in spin-1/2 Heisenberg systems using quantum Monte Carlo in the valence bond basis.  
We begin by presenting the quantum Monte Carlo techniques used in this research.
We then use these techniques to directly compare the recently proposed valence bond entanglement entropy to the standard definition of entanglement entropy: the von Neumann entanglement entropy. 
We find that the valence bond entanglement entropy does not give a bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy, and that it exhibits a multiplicative logarithmic correction to the area law that is not present in the scaling of the von Neumann entanglement entropy.
We then present a method to measure higher orders of the generalized Renyi entanglement entropies using valence bond quantum Monte Carlo, and show results for the second Renyi entropy.
We find the results converge to the exact results for one dimensional Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains, and see that the scaling of the second Renyi entropy follows an area law in the two dimensional Heisenberg ground state.

I would like to thank my collaborators in this research, Matthew Hastings for his seemingly endless supply of ideas, and Ivan Gonzalez for his expert use of DMRG, also Anders Sandvik for many helpful discussions as well as the creation of most of the techniques used for this research.
For many helpful conversations, either scientific or motivational in nature, I would like to thank Jeremy McMinis and both my parents, John Berlinsky and Catherine Kallin.
And finally, I would like to acknowledge the incredible patience and enthusiasm of my supervisor, Roger Melko.
