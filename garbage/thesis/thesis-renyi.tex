\chapter{Measuring Renyi Entanglement Entropy}
\label{chap:renyi}
%======================================================================

Though we are not able to measure \vn in VB QMC simulations, due to the inaccessiblity of the wavefunction of the system, using a ``replica trick'' we are able to measure ${\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^n)$ in our algorithm for $n>1$, which allows us to measure the Renyi entanglement entropies 
\begin{equation} \label{renyi2}
 	S_n(\rho_{\rm A}) = \frac{1}{1-n}\ln\left[{\rm Tr}\left( \rho_{\rm A}^n \right) \right],
\end{equation}
for $n>1$.  For $n>m$ these entropies have the property that $S_n \le S_m$, so the second Renyi entropy, $S_2$ will give the largest lower bound on \vN.
The Renyi entropies are expected to follow the same area laws obeyed by \vn \cite{Bbob}, making them equally useful in the study of universal quantities.
The Renyi entropies together also encode information about the whole entanglement spectrum of the system, and thus contain more information that \vn alone \cite{Bbob}.

In this chapter we begin by demonstrating the measurement of ${\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^n)$ using a replica trick, and we show the specific case for $n=2$ using a \sw operator on two copies of a system.
We measure $S_2$ in 1D first, using a double projector VB QMC algorithm and comparing the results to DMRG results for $S_2$.  
We also show results generated using the loop algorithm.
We develop a method to improve the sampling of our $S_2$ measurement using a different Monte Carlo weight, and measuring the ratio of \swa operators for different sizes of region A.
We then move to 2D, approaching the limit of DMRG simulations, and look at both $L\times L$ systems with periodic boundary conditions, and $M$-leg ladders, as in the previous chapter, with open boundary conditions.  
We find area law scaling of the entanglement entropy in both of these geometries \cite{PRL2}.
%We conclude with a discussion of methods to further improve the measurement of \re in VB QMC.

For this project I measured \re with the bare \swa operator using both a double projector VB QMC program, and a loop algorithm VB QMC program.  I also measured a ratio of \swa operators using a double projector code.  DMRG measurements were performed by I. Gonz\'alez and R. Melko.

%The Renyi entropies have the property that successive entropies give a lower bound on the previous entropies.  I.e. if $n>m$ then $S_n<S_m$, so \re gives a lower bound on \vN, and \re will give the closest estimate of \vN.
%
%We can use the expectation value of a unitary \sw operator on two non-interacting copies of the system to be studied in order to obtain ${\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^2)$, a quantity necessary to compute \re.  
%This process can be generalized to calculate any $S_n$ with $n \ge 2$, by applying a generalized \sw operator to $n$ copies of the system. 

\section{The ``Replica Trick''}

In order to calculate ${\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^n)$, a quantity necessary to measure the $n^{\rm th}$ Renyi entanglement entropy for $n\ge2$, we use a trick involving replicas of the system to be studied, $\Psi_0$.
We simulate $n$ non-interacting replicas of the system.  
The expectation value of a swap operator is measured. 
The purpose of the swap operator is to swap the state of the system in region A between the non-interacting replicas.
Calculating the expectation value of this operator accomplishes two things: it (1) reorganizes the replicas $\bra{\Psi_0 \otimes \Psi_0 \otimes \cdots \otimes \Psi_0}$ and $\ket{\Psi_0 \otimes \Psi_0 \otimes \cdots \otimes \Psi_0}$ into the density matrix $\rho^n$ while simultaneously (2) tracing out region B of the system.
This process is independent of the basis used, as the swap operator can be defined in any basis.
We using this method in the valence bond basis, but it has since been employed in finite temperature stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo \cite{kappa}, which uses the $S^z$ basis.
Below we show a method using two non-interacting copies of a system, and a \swa operator, to measure ${\rm Tr} (\rho^2_{\rm A})$, which is necessary for the calculation of \re.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The Swap Operator}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{figure} {
	\includegraphics[width=6.2 in]{./figures/made/swp.pdf} 
	\caption[Application of the Swap operator to two copies of a 6-site system]{
		\label{swap}
		(a) Two non-interacting copies, $\ket{\psi_1}$ and  $\ket{\psi_2}$, of a six-site chain
		where the left three sites of each copy belong to region A, and the other sites are in
		region B.
		
		(b) The same system from (a) after the $Swap_{\rm A}$ operator is applied.
		The endpoints of the valence bonds in region A are swapped between copies 
		of the system.  Region B remains unswapped.
	}
}\end{figure}

The \swa operator acts on two copies of the system (see Figure \ref{swap}), where the copies are not necessarily in the same state.  The action of \swa is to exchange the configuration of region A, between the two copies of the system.  If region A has some entanglement with region B in one or both of the copies of the system, then the two copies will become entangled after the application of \swA.
The \swa operator can be more clearly defined in a product basis such as the $S^z$ basis, in which an arbitrary state can be represented as a weighted sum of states decomposed into the separate a region A and a region B configuration.  
If we define $\{\ket{\alpha}\}$ as a complete basis of states spanning region A, and $\{\ket{\beta}\}$ as a complete basis of states spanning region B, then we can represent an arbitrary state as
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi} = \sum_{\alpha}\sum_{\beta} C_{\alpha,\beta}\ket{\alpha}\ket{\beta}
\end{equation}
for some set of coefficients $C_{\alpha,\beta}$.  
Then the effect of \swa on a two general states, $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ representing the two copies of the system, is
\begin{align}
	\SWA \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2}  &= 
		\SWA \left(\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1} 
		C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}\ket{\alpha_1}\ket{\beta_1}\right) \otimes
			\left(\sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2} 
		C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}\ket{\alpha_2}\ket{\beta_2}\right) \\
			&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}\sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2} 
			C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}
			\big(\ket{\alpha_2}\ket{\beta_1}\big)\otimes\big(\ket{\alpha_1}\ket{\beta_2}\big).
\end{align}
And the expectation value of \swa acting on two non-interacting copies of the ground state will be
\begin{align}
\langle \SWA \rangle &=
\bra{\Psi_0\otimes\Psi_0}\SWA \ket{\Psi_0\otimes\Psi_0} \\ 
	&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1} \sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}
		\overline{C}_{\alpha_2,\beta_1}C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}
		\overline{C}_{\alpha_1,\beta_2}C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}\\
	&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2} \bra{\alpha_1}\rho_{\rm A} \ket{\alpha_2} 
					\bra{\alpha_2}\rho_{\rm A} \ket{\alpha_1}\\
	&={\rm Tr (\rho_A^2)}.
\end{align}
For more detail see Appendix \ref{swaperator}.  From Equation \eqref{renyi} the second Renyi entanglement entropy is
\begin{equation}
	S_2(\rho_{\rm A}) = -\ln\!\left[{\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^2)\right] = -\ln\left( \langle \SWA \rangle \right), \label{swapspectation}
\end{equation}
independent of basis.  Specifically, we can use \eqref{swapspectation} in the valence bond basis, where the \swa operator acts to swap the endpoints of valence bonds within region A between copies of the system, as in Figure \ref{swap}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Measuring the Swap Operator}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we are using the double projector algorithm for these measurements (Section \ref{sec:dubproj}) we use equations \eqref{generalop1} and \eqref{generalop2} to measure the \swa operator,
\begin{equation}
\langle \SWA \rangle = 
 \frac{   \sum_{l,r} W^L_l W^R_r  \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle    
		\frac{   \bra{V^L_l} \SWA  \ket{V^R_r}  }{   \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle  }}
							{\sum_{l,r} W^L_l W_r^R \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle}
	= \left<
		\frac{   \bra{V^L} \SWA \ket{V^R}  }{   \bra{V^L} V^R\rangle  }
						\right>,
\label{swapmeas}
\end{equation}
though in this case $\ket{V^{\rm L}}$ and $\ket{V^{\rm R}}$ each contain two non-interacting copies of the system we want to study, depicted in Fig.~\ref{swap}.

\section{1D Results}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{figure} {
	\includegraphics[width=6in]{./figures/paper2/fig_1D/swapfig.pdf} 
	\caption[$S_2$ for a 100-site chain using double projector VB QMC and DMRG]{ 
	\label{swapfig}

		calculated with DMRG and VB QMC.  Data labeled ``Swap'' was calculated with Eq.~\eqref{swapmeas} with one VB QMC simulation.	
	}
}\end{figure}

We begin by measuring $S_2$ for a 1D OBC chain of length $L=100$, using the expectation value of the $Swap_x$ operator to find $S_2$ in VB QMC, where sites 1 through $x$ are included in region A. 
The trial state $\ket{V}$ used is a simple dimerized state with only nearest neighbor valence bonds.
Results are shown in Figure \ref{swapfig}.
In the DMRG simulations, $S_2$ is calculated in the standard way, using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix. 
One can immediately see that the calculation of $S_2$ with the expectation value $\langle \SWA \rangle$ gives very large statistical errors, especially for a large number of sites inside region A.

One way to understand this result is to consider what we are actually measuring.
From Eq. \eqref{swapmeas} one can see we are measuring the ratio of two inner products.
Since the overlap (Eq. \eqref{innprod}) is $2^{N_{\rm loop} - N_{\rm sites}/2}$, this ratio of inner products is $2^{N_{\rm swaploops} - N_{\rm loops}}$.
The quantity we measure depends entirely on the change in the number of loops after applying a swap operator to one of our states. 
For a large region A we are swapping a larger number of sites, and the difference in the number of loops can change by a large range of values.
We have to sample states for much longer to converge on the average change in the number of loops.
In contrast, swapping only one site ($x=1$) will always decrease the number of loops by 1, so $S_2(1)=\ln(2)$ always.
For two sites in region A, the difference in the number of loops can be $-2$ or 0.
So for a small region A, the change in the number of loops has fewer possible values.

%\change{Another way to look at it is that we are sampling terms in the trace of a much larger matrix for a large region A.}

One way to improve upon the poor sampling of  $\langle \SWA \rangle$ is using the loop algorithm (Section \ref{sec:loop}), which scales as $m$ while the double projector method scales like $Nm$.
Measurements taken using the loop algorithm are added in Figure \ref{loopfig}; they show a significant improvement over the double projector $\langle \SWA \rangle$ measurement, 
though there is still noticeable statistical error for large region A.
If our goal was simply the measurement of $S_2$ instead of the demonstration of the most effective way to measure $S_2$, we could note that $S_2(A) = S_2(B)$ and reflect the data about the midpoint, resulting in almost perfect correspondence with the DMRG data.
However, when we begin to measure larger system sizes and move to 2D the deficiencies in measuring the bare \swa operator will become increasingly apparent; it is necessary to improve upon this measurement technique, which we have done using an ``improved ratio'' sampling scheme.

\section{``Improved Ratio'' Sampling}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\begin{figure} {
	\includegraphics[width=6in]{./figures/paper2/fig_1D/ratiofig.pdf}

The ratio data uses $j_{\rm max}=5$ and requires 20 separate simulations.
	}
}\end{figure}

Instead of measuring  $\langle Swap_x \rangle$ for a region A including $x$ sites, we measure a ratio of different $Swap_x$ operators,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqratio}
\frac{\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle}{\langle Swap_{x}\rangle} = 
\frac{ \sum_{i,k} W^L_i W^R_k \bra{V^L_i}Swap_{x+j} \ket{V^R_k}}
							{\sum_{i,k} W^L_i W_k^R \bra{V^L_i} Swap_x \ket{ V^R_k}},
\end{equation}
where $j=1,\dots,j_{\rm max}$ is the difference between the region sizes for the two $Swap$ operators.
To get to the entanglement entropy from here we take the negative logarithm of \eqref{eqratio} to get
\begin{equation}
\label{eqratio2}
-\ln\left( \frac{\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle}{\langle Swap_{x}\rangle} \right) = 
-\ln \langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle + \ln\langle Swap_{x}\rangle   =   S_2(x+j) - S_2(x),
\end{equation}
so we can extract $S_2(x+j)$ if we have $S_2(x)$ from a previous measurement.
The sampling weight from \eqref{supaweight} is modified with this new measurement, to be
\begin{equation}
W_{\rm total} = W^LW^R\bra{V^L} Swap_x \ket{V^R}.
\end{equation}
However, modifying the sampling weight in this way means we can only measure the ratio \eqref{eqratio} for one value of $x$ per simulation.
To get $S_2$ for all region sizes we first choose a value for $j_{\rm max}$.
A small $j_{\rm max}$ means more improvement due to the ratio, but also more simulations are required.
We then measure the bare $\langle Swap_{j}\rangle$ for $j=1,\dots,j_{\rm max}$ in our first simulation.
The second simulation measures the ratio $\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle / \langle Swap_{x}\rangle$ with $x=j_{\rm max}$.  The following simulations use $x=2j_{\rm max}, 3j_{\rm max}, 4j_{\rm max}, \dots$ until we reach the maximum size of region A.
The number of simulations need for a 1D system is $(L/j_{\rm max})$.

Figure \ref{ratiofig} shows the ratio data using $j_{\rm max} = 5$, along with the DMRG data, for the same 100-site system as in Figs. \ref{loopfig} and \ref{swapfig}. 
The data no longer show the large statistical error bars for large region A sizes, though the results are systematically lower than the DMRG $S_2$ results for a region A-B boundary near the middle of the 100-site system.  
The improved ratio sampling unfortunately introduces a new source of systematic error not accounted for by our error bars.  
$S_2$ measurements for larger region sizes depend on the previous measurements, thus if a measurement for a small region A has some error, that will carry through to all other measurements, as one can see when comparing the regions of size $x=1$ and $x=99$ in Figure \ref{ratiofig}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{2D Results}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{figure} {
	\includegraphics[width=6in]{./figures/paper2/fig_2DA/L8n12_ratio.pdf} 
	\caption[$S_2$ in an $8 \times 8$ and a $12 \times 12$ system for different values of $r_{\rm max}$]{ 
	Measurements of $S_2/\ell$ for $8 \times 8$ and $12 \times 12$ PBC systems with a region A of size $\ell \time \ell$.
	The bare $\langle Swap_\ell \rangle$ results are shown along with the improved ratio results for different values of $r_{\rm max}$.
	\label{2Dfig}
	}
} \end{figure}

We now look at 2D $L\times L$ systems with PBC, where region A is an $\ell \times \ell$ and region B is the remainder of the system.
For this system we must slightly change the definition of our improved ratio estimator to fit the different geometry.
Instead of $j$ and $j_{\rm max}$ from \eqref{eqratio} and \eqref{eqratio2} we now use $r$ and $r_{\rm max}$, and measure $\langle Swap_{\ell+r}\rangle / \langle Swap_{\ell}\rangle$ where $\ell +r$ is the linear dimension of a square region A, and $r=1,\dots,r_{\rm max}$.
We increase the size of region A such that it is always a square, adding a row and column of sites simultaneously.

Figure \ref{2Dfig} shows the $Swap$ and ratio results for 2D PBC systems of size $8 \times 8$ and $12 \times 12$.
For the $8\times 8$ system the results are already almost entirely converged with the $Swap$ measurement, and the ratio measurements only offer a very slight improvement.
	When the system size is increased to $12 \times 12$ the ratio results significantly improve the measurement, though the $r_{\max} = 2$ and $r_{\max} = 1$ results almost exactly overlap, implying that the results have converged to the correct answer at that point.
	It is possible to improve the sampling even further adding one site at a time to the region size, instead of only increasing the linear dimension of region A.
	We should note that for large values of $r_{\rm max}$ the correct value of $S_2$ does not fall within the error bars of the data, indicating that the low sampling of the $Swap$ operator may weaken the ergodicity of the simulation.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Area Law}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the improved ratio estimator we now examine larger systems of the same geometry as was used in the previous section (PBC $L \times L$ systems with an $\ell \times\ell$ region A) in an attempt to extract area law scaling of the entanglement entropy.
Figure \ref{2Darea} show $S_2/\ell$ results for systems from $L=4$ to $L=32$.
From Section \ref{vbAlaw} and Ref. \cite{PRL1} one expects the scaling of $S_1 = \VN$ in the N\'eel state to follow the area law, and we know that $S_2 \le \VN$.
The data in Fig. \ref{2Darea} appears consistent with the area law $S_2/\ell \sim \text{const.}$ for $\ell \ll L$, in particular we do not see a multiplicative log correction that was present in the scaling of \vb \cite{Alet, Chh}. 

\begin{figure} {
	\includegraphics[width=5in]{./figures/paper2/fig_AreaL/fig4.pdf}

The data were measured using the 2D improved ratio estimator using $j_{\rm max} = M$.
		\label{2Dbetter2}
	}

} \end{figure}

Next we examine entanglement entropy scaling for the ladder geometry studied in Section \ref{vbAlaw} and Ref. \cite{PRL1}.
The results are shown in Figure \ref{2Dbetter1}, including both DMRG and ratio estimator VB QMC data.  
From the DMRG data alone it is not immediately apparent that $S_2/M \sim$ const., especially considering the trend in the first few data points. 
Fortunately, the range of system sizes we can study is extended by the \swa measurement with VB QMC, and the added points make it clear that $S_2$ does in fact follow an area law for the N\'eel state.

In Figure \ref{2Dbetter2} we examine the same systems with only $M^2$ sites in region A.
For the small system sizes we see much larger even-odd oscillations, as we go to larger system sizes both Figs. \ref{2Dbetter1} and \ref{2Dbetter2} follow the same area law scaling.

\section{Discussion}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We have presented a method which can be used to measure the Renyi entropies for $n>1$, with quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the valence bond basis, employing a ``replica trick".
We demonstrate this method by measuring the second Renyi entropy $S_2$ using the expectation value of a \swa operator acting on two copies of the system.
With the use of a ratio estimator we improve the sampling of our algorithm and our results for $S_2$ converge to the exact results for a 1D Heisenberg chain with open boundaries.
Using this same method we present the first measurements of $S_2$ on 2D periodic $L \times L$ and open boundary ladder systems, confirming the area law for the N\'eel ground state of the Heisenberg model.
