A six-site chain, with two non-interacting copies (top and bottom) before
(a) and after (b) the $Swap_A$ operation. % in the valence bond basis.  
The region $A$ consists of three light-colored sites on the left; the
complement region $B$ of three dark sites on the right.  The curved lines denote
singlets in the state $|V_{r}\rangle$, which is a product of two
different valence bond states, one per copy.
The ground state of the entire system is a linear combination of similar $|V_{r}\rangle$.

The Renyi entropy $S_2$ as a function of site index $i \in A$, for a 100-site Heisenberg chain with open boundaries, 
calculated with DMRG and QMC.  Data labeled ``Swap'' was calculated with Eq.~eqref{Swap} with one QMC simulation, while
data labeled $j_{\rm max}=5$ was calculated with Eq.~eqref{Ratio} using 20 separate QMC simulations with a range of  $j \in [1,5]$.  The inset shows the convergence of $S_2$ to the exact value (dashed line) for $i=6$ with up to $m=4000$.
