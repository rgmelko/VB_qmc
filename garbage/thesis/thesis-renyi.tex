The generalized Renyi entanglement entropies, again defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{renyi2}
 	S_n(\rho_{\rm A}) = \frac{1}{1-n}\ln\left[{\rm Tr}\left( \rho_{\rm A}^n \right) \right],
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm{A}}=\rm{Tr}_B\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the reduced density matrix of region A, and $n>0$.

(But that's just because if you know all of them you pretty much know all the eigenvalues of $\rho_{\rm A}$.)
So they have more information together than just $S_1=\VN$. \cite{Spectrum}

The Renyi entropies have the property that successive entropies give a lower bound on the previous entropies.  I.e. if $n>m$ then $S_n<S_m$, so \re gives a lower bound on \vN, and \re will give the closest estimate of \vN.

We can use the expectation value of a unitary \sw operator on two non-interacting copies of the system to be studied in order to obtain ${\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^2)$, a quantity necessary to compute \re.  
This process can be generalized to calculate any $S_n$ with $n \ge 2$, by applying a generalized \sw operator to $n$ copies of the system.

	}
}\end{figure}

The \swa operator acts on two copies of the system (see Figure \ref{swap}), where the copies are not necessarily in the same state.  The action of \swa is to exchange the configuration of region A, between the two copies of the system.  If region A has some entanglement with region B in one of both of the copies of the system, then the two copies will become entangled after the application of \swA.
The \swa operator can be more clearly defined in a basis such as the $S^z$ basis, in which an arbitrary state can be represented as a weighted sum of states decomposed into the separate a region A and a region B configuration.  
If we define $\{\ket{\alpha}\}$ as a complete basis of states spanning region A, and $\{\ket{\beta}\}$ as a complete basis of states spanning region B, then we can represent an arbitrary state as
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi} = \sum_{\alpha}\sum_{\beta} C_{\alpha,\beta}\ket{\alpha}\ket{\beta}
\end{equation}
for some set of coefficients $C_{\alpha,\beta}$.  
Then the effect of \swa on a two general states, $\ket{\psi_1}$ and $\ket{\psi_2}$ representing the two copies of the system, is
\begin{align}
	\SWA \ket{\psi_1} \otimes \ket{\psi_2}  &= 
		\SWA \left(\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1} 
		C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}\ket{\alpha_1}\ket{\beta_1}\right) \otimes
			\left(\sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2} 
		C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}\ket{\alpha_2}\ket{\beta_2}\right) \\
			&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}\sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2} 
			C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}
			\big(\ket{\alpha_2}\ket{\beta_1}\big)\otimes\big(\ket{\alpha_1}\ket{\beta_2}\big).
\end{align}
And the expectation value of \swa acting on two non-interacting copies of the ground state will be
\begin{align}
\langle \SWA \rangle &=
\bra{\Psi_0\otimes\Psi_0}\SWA \ket{\Psi_0\otimes\Psi_0} \\ 
	&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\beta_1} \sum_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}
		\overline{C}_{\alpha_2,\beta_1}C_{\alpha_1,\beta_1}
		\overline{C}_{\alpha_1,\beta_2}C_{\alpha_2,\beta_2}\\
	&=\sum_{\alpha_1,\alpha_2} \bra{\alpha_1}\rho_{\rm A} \ket{\alpha_2} 
					\bra{\alpha_2}\rho_{\rm A} \ket{\alpha_1}\\
	&={\rm Tr (\rho_A^2)}.
\end{align}
For more detail see Appendix \ref{swaperator}.  From Equation \eqref{renyi} the second Renyi entanglement entropy is
\begin{equation}
	S_2(\rho_{\rm A}) = -\ln\!\left[{\rm Tr}(\rho_{\rm A}^2)\right] = -\ln\left( \langle \SWA \rangle \right), \label{swapspectation}
\end{equation}
independent of basis.  Specifically, we can use \eqref{swapspectation} in the valence bond basis, where the \swa operator acts to swap the endpoints of valence bonds within region A between copies of the system, as in Figure \ref{swap}.

\subsection{Measuring the Swap Operator}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we are using the double projector algorithm for these measurements (Section \ref{sec:dubproj}) we use equations \eqref{generalop1} and \eqref{generalop2} to measure the \swa operator,
\begin{equation}
\langle \SWA \rangle = 
 \frac{   \sum_{l,r} W^L_l W^R_r  \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle    
		\frac{   \bra{V^L_l} \SWA  \ket{V^R_r}  }{   \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle  }}
							{\sum_{l,r} W^L_l W_r^R \bra{V^L_l} V^R_r\rangle}
	= \left<
		\frac{   \bra{V^L} \SWA \ket{V^R}  }{   \bra{V^L} V^R\rangle  }
						\right>,
\label{swapmeas}
\end{equation}
though in this case $\ket{V^{\rm L}}$ and $\ket{V^{\rm R}}$ each contain two non-interacting copies of the system we want to study, depicted in Fig.~\ref{swap}.

\section{1D Results}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	\includegraphics[width=6in]{./figures/paper2/fig_1D/swapfig.pdf} 
	\caption[Renyi for 100 site chain]{ 
	\label{swapfig}

		calculated with DMRG and VB QMC.  Data labeled ``Swap'' was calculated with Eq.~\eqref{swapmeas} with one VB QMC simulation.	
	}
}\end{figure}

We begin by measuring $S_2$ for a 1D OBC chain of length $L=100$, using the expectation value of the $Swap_x$ operator to find $S_2$ in VB QMC, where sites 1 through $x$ are included in region A. 
The trial state $\ket{V}$ used is a simple dimerized state with only nearest neighbor valence bonds.
Results are shown in Figure \ref{swapfig}.
In the DMRG simulations, $S_2$ is calculated in the standard way, using the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix. 
One can immediately see that the calculation of $S_2$ with the expectation value $\langle \SWA \rangle$ gives very large statistical errors, especially for a large number of sites inside region A.

One way to understand to consider what we are actually measuring.
From Eq. \eqref{swapmeas} one can see we are measuring the ratio of two inner products.
Since the overlap (Eq. \eqref{innprod}) is $2^{N_{\rm loop} - N_{\rm sites}/2}$, this ratio of inner products is $2^{N_{\rm swaploops} - N_{\rm loops}}$.
The quantity we measure depends entirely of the change in the number of loops after applying a swap operator to one of our states. 
For a large region A we are swapping a larger number of sites, and the difference in the number of loops can change by a large number, or a small number. 
We have to sample states for much longer to converge on the average change in the number of loops.
In contrast, swapping only one site ($x=1$) will always decrease the number of loops by 1, so $S_2(1)=\ln(2)$ always.
For two sites in region A, the difference in the number of loops can be $-2$ or 0. \comment{Check the numbers, and maybe extend or find a formula.} 
\comment{Cram some diagrams of this up in here.}
\change{
Another way to look at it is that we are sampling terms in the trace of a much larger matrix for a large region A.}

One way to improve upon the poor sampling of  $\langle \SWA \rangle$ is using the loop algorithm (Section \ref{sec:loop}), which \change{has much better scaling?} than the double projector method.
Measurements taken using the loop algorithm are added into Figure \ref{loopfig}; they show a significant improvement over the double projector $\langle \SWA \rangle$ measurement, 
though there is still noticeable statistical error for large region A.
If our goal was simply the measurement of $S_2$ instead of the demonstration of the most effective way to measure $S_2$, we could simply note that $S_2(A) = S_2(B)$ and reflect the data about the midway point resulting in almost perfect correspondence with the DMRG data.
However, when we begin to measure larger system sizes and move to 2D the deficiencies in measuring the bare \swa operator will become even more apparent; it is necessary to improve upon this measurement technique, which we have done using an ``improved ratio'' sampling scheme.

\section{``Improved Ratio'' Sampling}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instead of measuring  $\langle Swap_x \rangle$ for a region A including $x$ sites, we measure a ratio of different $Swap_x$ operators,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqratio}
\frac{\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle}{\langle Swap_{x}\rangle} = 
\frac{ \sum_{l,r} W^L_l W^R_r \bra{V^L_l}Swap_{x+j} \ket{V^R_r}}
							{\sum_{l,r} W^L_l W_r^R \bra{V^L_l} Swap_x \ket{ V^R_r}},
\end{equation}
where $j=1,\dots,j_{\rm max}$ is the difference between the region sizes for the two $Swap$ operators.
To get to the entanglement entropy from here we take the negative logarithm of \eqref{eqratio} to get
\begin{equation}
-\ln\left( \frac{\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle}{\langle Swap_{x}\rangle} \right) = 
-\ln \langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle + \ln\langle Swap_{x}\rangle   =   S_2(x+j) - S_2(x),
\end{equation}
so we can extract $S_2(x+j)$ if we have $S_2(x)$ from a previous measurement.
The sampling weight from \eqref{supaweight} is modified with this new measurement, to be
\begin{equation}
W_{\rm total} = W^LW^R\bra{V^L} Swap_x \ket{V^R}.
\end{equation}
However, modifying the sampling weight in this way means we can only measure the ratio \eqref{eqratio} for one value of $x$ per simulation.
To get $S_2$ for all region sizes we first choose a value for $j_{\rm max}$.
A small $j_{\rm max}$ means more improvement due to the ratio, but also more simulations are required.
We then measure the bare $\langle Swap_{j}\rangle$ for $j=1,\dots,j_{\rm max}$ in our first simulation.
The second simulation measures the ratio $\langle Swap_{x+j}\rangle / \langle Swap_{x}\rangle$ with $x=j_{\rm max}$.  The following simulations use $x=2j_{\rm max}, 3j_{\rm max}, 4j_{\rm max}, \dots$ until we reach the maximum size of region A.
The number of simulations need for a 1D system is $(L/j_{\rm max})$.

\comment{build up to large region sizes}


We start with $x=0$, equivalence to measuring $\langle Swap_x \rangle$ without any ratio involved.
Choosing $j_{\rm max}$ determines
