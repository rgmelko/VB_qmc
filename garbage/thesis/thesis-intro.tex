Then in Chapter 2 we describe quantum Monte Carlo algorithms in the valence bond basis.
Chapter 3 contains measurements of a quantity called the valence bond entanglement entropy compared to the standard measure of entropy, the von Neumann entanglement entropy.
In Chapter 4 we develop a method of measuring the Renyi entanglement entropies, excluding the von Neuman entanglement entropy, using valence bond quantum Monte Carlo.
In the final chapter we summarize the results of this research.

\section{Quantum Entanglement}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Entanglement is what differentiates quantum mechanical systems from classical systems.
In a pair of entangled spins/particles/photons/states the members of the system have information about the other member, even if they are spatially separated.
Two, let's go with spins, are considered entangled if their joint state can not be written as the product of their individual states.  For example, of these states,
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Psi_{1,2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{\up_1\up_2} + \ket{\dw_1\dw_2}\big) 
	\hspace{1cm} \text{and} \hspace{1cm}
	\ket{\Phi_{1,2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{\up_1\dw_2} - \ket{\dw_1\dw_2}\big), 
\end{equation}
only $\ket{\Phi_{1,2}}$ is separable, and can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\Phi_{1,2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}  \big( \ket{\up_1} - \ket{\dw_1}\big) \otimes \ket{\dw_2}.
\end{equation}
In the case of only two spins it is easy to see that states are separable (unentangled), but adding more spins it becomes less apparent which spin states are entangled.
Of course, I have said nothing of the degree of entanglement, only that separable states are entangled, and non-separable states are unentangled.

\section{Measures of Entanglement}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many different quantities that can be used to measure entanglement: concurrence, logarithmic negativity, squashed entanglement, entropy of entanglement, to name a few.
Three properties are shared by all measures of entanglement \cite{Plenio2005},
\begin{enumerate}
\item A bipartite entanglement measure $E(\rho)$ (measuring the entanglement between two qubits) is a mapping from density matrices to positive real numbers defined for states of arbitrary bipartite systems.
Usually a normalization factor is included such that the maximally entangled state,
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_{\rm max}}  = \frac{\ket{0,0} + \ket{1,1}}{\sqrt{2}},
\end{equation}
 of two qubits has $E(\ket{\psi_{\rm max}}\bra{\psi_{\rm max}}) = \ln(2)$.
 \item  $E(\rho)=0$ if the state $\rho$ is separable.
 \item $E(\rho)$ does not increase under local operators on either of the qubits.  That is, if we have an operator acting on only {\it one} of the qubit, the entanglement between the two qubits will never increase.
% \item For a pure state $\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ the measure reduces to the von Neumann entanglement entropy.
\end{enumerate}
There is also a fourth condition, not satisfied by all measures of entanglement, requiring the measure to reduce to the von Neumann entanglement entropy for a system in a pure state.

\section{The von Neumann Entanglement Entropy}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a system partitioned into two regions, A and B, the von Neumann entanglement entropy \vn is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\VN_\text{A} = -\rm{Tr}\left({\rho_A \ln \rho_A}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm{A}}=\rm{Tr}_B\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the reduced density matrix, the density matrix of the entire system with the degrees of freedom from region B traced out.
\vn is only suited to measure the entanglement of a pure state, as is the case for all the entanglement measures we will discuss in this thesis.
This is due to the way \vn measures entanglement; we begin with a pure state and trace out the degrees of freedom for some subregion B.  
We are left with $\rho_{\rm A}$ representing a, possibly mixed, state.
\vn can be rewritten in terms of the eigenvalues of the density matrix,
\begin{equation}
\VN_\text{A} = -\sum_i \left(\lambda_i \ln \lambda_i\right),
\end{equation}
which, you may notice, is quite similar to the thermodynamic entropy, or alternatively the Shannon information entropy.
Basically, we measure the uncertainty of the state.  If $\rho_{\rm A}$ represents a pure state we {\bf know} what state of region A is in, and $\rho_{\rm A}$ will have one non-zero eigenvalue equal to 1 (so $\VN = 0$).
If $\rho_{\rm A}$ represents a mixed state, we will have some probability distribution of the possible states, and the entropy of that distribution is used to quantify the entanglement between regions A and B.
In the maximally entangled case all eigenvalues are equal to $1/d$, where $d$ is the dimension of $\rho_{\rm A}$ ($2^N$ for $N$ spins), leading to the entanglement entropy of $\VN= \ln (d) = N \ln(2)§$.  
However, returning to my previous point, if the initial state starts off mixed instead of pure, the state would already have some entropy not due to tracing out region B; added to our entanglement measurement would be the initially present classical uncertainty in the state.

The von Neumann entanglement entropy is part of a larger class of entanglement entropies called the generalized Renyi entanglement entropies.
The $n^\text{th}$ Renyi entanglement entropy $S_n$ is defined as
\begin{equation} \label{renyi}
 	S_n(\rho_{\rm A}) = \frac{1}{1-n}\ln\left[{\rm Tr}\left( \rho_{\rm A}^n \right) \right].
\end{equation}
%It may not be immediately apparent that $\VN = S_1$, but if we take the limit as $n\to 1$,
%\begin{equation}
%S_1(\rho_{\rm A}) = \lim_{n\to1}\frac{\ln\left[{\rm Tr}\left( \rho_{\rm A}^n \right) \right]}{1-n}
%	=\lim_{n\to1}\frac{\frac{d}{dn}\ln\left[{\rm Tr}\left( \rho_{\rm A}^n \right) \right]}{\frac{d}{dn}(1-n)}
%\end{equation}
Taking the limit $n\to1$ gives us $S_1 = \VN$.  These entanglement entropies have the property that for $n>m$, $S_n\ge S_m$; successive Renyi entropies give a lower bound on the previous entropies.

\section{Entanglement in Condensed Matter Systems}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using measures of entanglement from quantum information to study interacting quantum many-body systems is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary topic \cite{Amico, intro}.
Entanglement provides information on ``hidden'' correlations \cite{wolf}.
In systems that exhibit topological order, entanglement measures can be used to quantify that order \cite{Bbob, KP, LW, Spectrum}, which is missed by standard measurements like two-point correlation functions.
Entanglement has the added benefit of being independent of the basis used to represent the condensed matter system.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Scaling of Entanglement Entropy}
\label{1dcft}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scaling of \vn is well understood in 1D systems \cite{ALreview} where, away from special critical points, entanglement between two regions scales as the size of the boundary between those regions.
This ``area law'' \cite{Shredder} is expected to hold in the ground states many 2D interacting quantum systems, though there are few exact results available.

The scaling of entanglement has potential ramifications for the rapidly advancing field of computational quantum many-body theory, where it is known that states obeying area law scaling    can be accurately represented with matrix product states \cite{MPS_DMRG}, while faster than area law scaling presents difficulties.
Some new classes of algorithms, Tensor-network states and projected entangled pair states, rely on states that are explicitly constructed to obey an area law \cite{PEPS1,PEPS2}.

The scaling of entanglement entropy in 2D is also known to hold information about universal quantities.
In critical systems the area law scaling has universal additive logarithmic corrections \cite{Casini2007,Ryu}, and for topologically ordered systems there are universal additive constant corrections \cite{KP,LW}.

The 1D Heisenberg spin chain is critical, and the entanglement entropy is known to scale as \cite{Cardy} \cite{Zhou2006}
\begin{equation} \label{cft1d} 
	\VN_{\text{PBC}} = \frac{c}{3}\ln(x') + s_1
	\hspace{1cm}
	\VN_{\text{OBC}} = \frac{c}{6}\ln(2x') + \ln(g)+ s_1
\end{equation}
for systems with open and periodic boundary conditions, where $c$ is the central charge from conformal field theory, $g$ is a universal boundary term \cite{AffleckAndLudwig}, and $s_1$ is a model dependent constant. $x'$ is the conformal mapping for the number of sites included in region A, used to account for the finite size of the Heisenberg chains, when \eqref{cft1d} applies in the long chain-length limit.  $x \rightarrow x' = (L/\pi)\sin(\pi x/L)$ for PBC and $x \rightarrow 2x'$ for OBC, where L is the length of the chain.

For 2D Heisenberg spin systems with topological order, the entanglement entropy is known to scale as \cite{intro}
\begin{equation} \label{AL}
S_{\rm A} = \alpha \ell - n \gamma + \mathcal{O}(1/\ell),
\end{equation}
where $\ell$ is the length of the boundary, $\gamma$ is the topological entanglement entropy\cite{KP,LW}, and $n$ is related to the shape of the boundary.

\section{Measurement of Entanglement Entropy}

To study and extract these universal quantities it is necessary to be able to measure entanglement entropy in a scalable type of simulation, such as quantum Monte Carlo where we can go to large system sizes.
Unfortunately, the entanglement entropy is a property of the wavefunction of a system, which is not readily accessible in quantum Monte Carlo simulations.  
Though we can measure entropy directly in simulations that give us the wavefunction or density matrix of the system, such as density matrix renormalization group simulations (DMRG), these types of algorithms have poor scaling in the system size, and DMRG specifically works well in 1D, but fails when approaching two dimensions.
In this thesis we explore methods of measuring entanglement entropy in quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
