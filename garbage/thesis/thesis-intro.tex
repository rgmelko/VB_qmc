\comment{Dude, something is totally wrong with the figure references.  They don't match up 
with the actual figure number.  Look into that, and equation reference, and other stuff too... just
to be sure.}

Since the dawn of time man has struggled to...

%scaling\\
%universal quantities...\\
%The search for topological order\\
%looking at quantum critical points\\
%area law\\
%new attempts at entropies:\\
%- 
%\\

%According to G. Vidal: \\
%- the way tensor network states are constructed they can't have entropy scaling faster than area law\\

\noindent Explain entanglement\\
Explain measures of entanglement\\

Corrections to Area Law\\
