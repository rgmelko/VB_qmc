\section{The von Neumann Entanglement Entropy}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a system divided into two regions, A and B, the von Neumann entanglement entropy is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\VN_\text{A} = -\rm{Tr}\left({\rho_A \ln \rho_A}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\rho_{\rm{A}}=\rm{Tr}_B\ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the reduced density matrix, that is, the density matrix of the entire system, with the degrees of freedom from region B traced out.

\section{The Area Law and Conformal Field Theory}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In one dimensional interacting quantum systems, there are exact analytical results for the scaling of the von Neumann entanglement entropy know from Conformal field theory (CFT).
These results show that away from critical points $\VN_\text{A}$ scales like the size of the boundary between regions A and B.  This scaling of entanglement entropy is called the {\it area law} \cite{Shredder}, and it has quite recently been shown by Beaudrap {\it et al.} that the area law holds in ground states of two dimensional unfrustrated spin systems \cite{DeBeaudrap2010}.

\comment{Should I put the area law stuff *in* the CFT section?  That's what happens in the paper.  It says that CFT results give the area law for 1D and it's believed to hold in 2D too.}

\comment{Don't forget about corrections to the area law.}

\comment{Also, consequences of things not following the area law.  
(harder to simulate if entanglement scales faster than the area law).}

\subsection{1D Critical Systems}
\label{1dcft}

\cite{Cardy} \cite{Zhou2006}

described by CFT in the limit of the length of the chain, $L \rightarrow \infty$.
\comment{Something about the "conformal mapping" $x \rightarrow x' = (L/\pi)\sin(\pi x/L)$ for PBC
and $x \rightarrow 2x'$ for OBC.}

\begin{equation} \label{cft1d}
	\VN_{\text{OBC}} = \frac{c}{3}\ln(x') + S_1
	\hspace{1cm}
	\VN_{\text{PBC}} = \frac{c}{6}\ln(2x') + \ln(g)+ S_1
\end{equation}
\change{where $c$ is the central charge of the CFT, $S_1$ is a model-dependent constant, and $g$ is Affleck and Ludwig's universal boundary term \cite{AffleckAndLudwig}.} 
\comment{$\leftarrow$ the {\bf most} plagiarized? }

\comment{Talk about what values $c$ can take.  From Cardy and Zhou it seems like $c=1/2,1$, but in our case it's 1.}
