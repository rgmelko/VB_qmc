Re: LN11981
   Measuring Renyi entanglement entropy with quantum Monte Carlo
   by Matthew B. Hastings, Iv\'an Gonz\'alez, Ann B. Kallin, et al.


Dear Dr. Millev

We thank the referees for their thorough and thoughtful reviews on our 
manuscript.  Referee A states "I recommend it for publication in Physical 
Review Letters."  Referee C ends his report with "... I found the
paper proposes a new idea for numerical method which may work
generally, which could be appreciated for PRL."  Referee B states "Perhaps 
this is broad enough in the editor's estimation to merit publication 
in PRL...".  We believe that all of these statement indicate the referees'
(conditional) approval with publication in PRL.  We have made some specific
changes to the manuscript that we believe improve the discussion significantly,
answering we trust all referee criticism.  Specific responses to referee
queries follow below, however we note the folling general changes to the 
paper:

First, Referees A and C had a common criticism, namely that our proof relating
the expectation value of the Swap operator to the Renyi entropy S_2 was 
insufficiently clear.  We have considerably lengthened the proof around
equations (3) and (4), as detailed below, that we believe will allow for
a straight-forward derivation of the relationship.   Further, following
Referee A's suggestion, we add a reference to this relationship (it
is sometimes called the "replica trick", though there are several
techniques that go by that name).  For preciseness
we define the operator Swap_A within a product basis (a basis which is
unentangled between sites within A and those outside of A).  However,
since the valence bond state is not a product basis, we also explain the
action of Swap_A within the valence bond basis, both verbally
and pictorially.  We clarified a few points: the two copies of the system do
not interact, so that the ground state of the combined system is a product of
the ground state on the two copies and in fact each copy has the same
ground state.  However, each copy has interactions
connecting sites in A to those in B.  Thus, the ground state of a given
copy is in general not a product state between A and B (indeed, this is why it has
a non-vanishing entanglement entropy).  Finally, while the ground state
of the combined system is a product between the two copies, each such
state on the copy is a sum of many different valence bond states which
we sample using quantum Monte Carlo; since we
compute the expectation value of Swap_A using Monte Carlo sampling,
on a given Monte Carlo sample the state we consider is a product
state between the two copies but need not be the same state on each copy.

Regarding the general critisim of Referee B regarding interest in this
paper outside the numerical community, we have in fact already received significant
interest from people within the quantum information science community.  More generally,
we note the intense recent research interest in entanglement entropy in various models.
We have cited several different papers, in fields ranging from condensed matter
physics to topological quantum computing to high energy physics, where universal terms have been found.  However,
while this large body of exciting theoretical work may offer new ways to characterize
many-body systems, it has never received any experimental confirmation because, simply
put, there is no way to experimentally measure entanglement entropy on a many-body interacting system.
In this case, numerical work is essential to test the theoretical predictions.  By opening
the way to a numerical test of some of these predictions (predictions that rely on techniques
as diverse as the AdS/CFT correspondance and as the method of stabilizer codes), we anticipate
that our paper will generate interest among many fields of physics.  Further, it will
allow a numerical diagnostic for exotic phases characterized by entanglement properties,
increasing the recent collaboration between numerics and theory.  As evidence for this prediction,
we would like simply to mention the activity in studying entanglement properties of one-dimensional
systems using DMRG; we hope that our work will lead to similar activity in certain higher dimensional systems.

Finally, we are happy to note that we have improved the data in figures
2 to 4 on two fronts.  First, the time period corresponding to this review
process has allowed us to run simulations longer to improve data (in 
particular, larger system sizes in figures 3 and 4).  Second, thanks to 
a thorough error analysis of our data by a colleague, we have identified a 
small systematic error in our analysis (a minor error in the numerical
code we used to store binned data) which happened to affect data with 
large statistical fluctuations.  The most important change is the "bare"
swap data in figure 2, which the reader will now notice has larger error 
bars and a mean closer to the exact answer (an improvement caused by a
combination of the two points above).  The reanalysis of the data has 
led to only a slight change in the conclusions of the paper, specifically 
that the discrepency of the swap to ratio estimators is related to poor
sampling statistics and *not* necessarily ergodicity breaking; the relevant
parts have been updated.  The general conclusions of the paper are unchanged,
and in fact the applicability of this techniques has been, if anything,
increased.

In summary, we believe that our thourough consideration of referee criticism
has significantly improved our manuscript, and therefore we hope the 
referees and editor agree that publication in PRL is now appropriate.
