Re: LN11981
   Measuring Renyi entanglement entropy with quantum Monte Carlo
   by Matthew B. Hastings, Iv\'an Gonz\'alez, Ann B. Kallin, et al.


Dear Dr. Millev

We thank the referees for their thorough and thoughful reviews on our 
manuscript.  Referee A states "I recommend it for publication in Physical 
Review Letters."  Referee C ends his report with "... I found the
paper proposes a new idea for numerical method which may work
generally, which could be appreciated for PRL."  Referee B states "Perhaps 
this is broad enough in the editor's estimation to merit publication 
in PRL...".  We believe that all of these statement indicate the referees'
(conditional) approval with publication in PRL.  We have made some specific
changes to the manuscript that we believe improve the discussion significantly,
answering we trust all referee criticism.  Specific responses to referee
queries follow below, however we note the folling general changes to the 
paper:

First, Referees A and C had a common criticism, namely that our proof relating
the expectation value of the Swap operator to the Renyi entropy S2 was 
insufficiently opaque.  We have considerably lengthened the proof around
equations (3) and (4), as detailed below, that we belive will allow for
a straight-forward derivation of the relationship. 

Regard the general critisim of Referee B regarding "Broad interest..." MATT?

Finally, we are happy to note that we have improved the data in figures
2 to 4 on two fronts.  First, the time period corresponding to this review
process has allowed us to run simulations longer to improve data (in 
particular, larger system sizes in figures 3 and 4).  Second, thanks to 
a thorough error analysis of our data by a colleague, we have identified a 
small systematic error in our analysis which happened to affect data with 
large statistical fluctuations.  The most important change is the "bare"
swap data in figure 2, which the reader will now notice has larger error 
bars and a mean closer to the exact answer (an improvement caused by a
combination of the two points above).  The reanalysis of the data has 
led to only a slight change in the conclusions of the paper, specifically 
that the discrepency of the swap to ratio estimators is related to poor
sampling statistics and *not* necessarily ergodicity breaking; the relevant
parts have been updated.  The general conclusions of the paper are unchanged.

In summary, we believe that our thourough consideration of referee criticism
has significantly improved our manuscript, and therefore we hope the 
referees and editor agree that publication in PRL is now appropriate.
