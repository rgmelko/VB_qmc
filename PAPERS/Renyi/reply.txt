Re: LN11981
   Measuring Renyi entanglement entropy with quantum Monte Carlo
   by Matthew B. Hastings, Ivan Gonzalez, Ann B. Kallin, and Roger G. Melko


Dear Dr. Millev

We thank the referees for their thorough and thoughtful reviews on our
manuscript.  Referee A states "I recommend it for publication in Physical
Review Letters."  Referee C ends his report with "... I found the paper
proposes a new idea for numerical method which may work generally, which
could be appreciated for PRL."  Referee B states "Perhaps this is broad
enough in the editor's estimation to merit publication in PRL...".  We
believe that all of these statements indicate the referees' (conditional)
approval of publication in PRL.  We have made some specific changes to
the manuscript that we think improve the discussion significantly,
answering all referee criticisms.  General changes in the manuscript are
outlined in the three paragraphs below; specific reponses to referee 
queries are at bottom.

[1]
First, Referees A and C had a common criticism, namely that our proof
relating the expectation value of the Swap operator to the Renyi entropy
S_2 was insufficiently clear.  We have considerably lengthened the proof
around equations (3) and (4), as detailed below, that we believe will
allow for a straight-forward derivation of the relationship. Further,
following Referee A's suggestion, we have added a reference [13] to this
relationship (it is sometimes called the "replica trick", though there are
several techniques that go by that name). It is important to note that
equation (5) is basis independent, although for convenience we have used a
product basis in equations (3) and (4) to prove it. The key ingredients of
the proof are that the two copies of the system are identical and that the
state of the combined system is the product state of the states of each
copy. This is guaranteed by the fact that the two copies do not interact
with each other, and therefore, the ground state of the combined system
that the QMC will sample is simply the product of the ground state on the
two copies. This is now stated in the text after equation (3) and with the
added citation to reference [13]. Despite this generality, we wanted to
provide the reader with a simple and self-contained proof of equation (5),
and for this reason we choose to work in a product state basis in
equations (3) and (4).  Our QMC algorithm works in the valence bond basis,
therefore we wish to explain the action of the Swap_A operator in this
basis. Here, the action of Swap_A is very simple: it just swaps the
endpoints of valence bonds between real and ancillary copies in the region
A. We explain this in the text after equation (5), as well as in the
revised caption to figure (1). Note that valence bond basis states are in
general *not* product states between A and B (indeed, this contributes to
the non-vanishing entanglement entropy), as Referee B points out with
certainty, and we show in figure (1).  While the ground state of the
combined system is a product between the two copies, each such state on
the copy is a sum of many different valence bond states, having the
general expansion stated in equation (2). Because of this linear
combination, the computation of the expectation value of Swap_A using
Monte Carlo sampling will involve the action of Swap_A on product states
of two, in general, different valence bond states, each corresponding to
one of the copies. This is what we illustrate in figure 1. To clarify this
point to the reader we have added a more detailed explanation in figure
1's caption.

[2]
Second, regarding the general critisim of Referee B about the interest in
this paper outside the numerical community, we have in fact already
received significant interest from people within the quantum information
science community.  More generally, we note the intense recent research
interest in entanglement entropy in various models.  We have cited several
different papers, in fields ranging from condensed matter physics to
topological quantum computing to high energy physics, where universal
terms have been found.  However, while this large body of exciting
theoretical work may offer new ways to characterize many-body systems, it
has never received any experimental confirmation because, simply put,
there is no way to experimentally measure entanglement entropy on a
many-body interacting system.  In this case, numerical work is essential
to test the theoretical predictions.  By opening the way to a numerical
test of some of these predictions (predictions that rely on techniques as
diverse as the AdS/CFT correspondence and as the method of stabilizer
codes), we anticipate that our paper will generate interest among many
fields of physics.  Further, it will allow a numerical diagnostic for
exotic phases characterized by entanglement properties, increasing the
recent collaboration between numerics and theory.  As evidence for this
prediction, we would like simply to mention the activity in studying
entanglement properties of one-dimensional systems using DMRG; we hope
that our work will lead to similar activity in certain higher dimensional
systems.

[3]
Finally, we are happy to note that we have improved the data in figures
2 to 4 on two fronts.  First, the time period corresponding to this review
process has allowed us to run simulations longer to improve data (in 
particular, larger system sizes in figures 3 and 4).  Second, thanks to 
a thorough error analysis of our data by a colleague, we have identified a 
minor systematic error in our analysis (in the numerical code used to store 
binned QMC data), which happened to affect data with large statistical 
fluctuations.  The most important change is the "bare" swap data in 
figure 2, which the reader will now notice has larger error bars and a 
mean closer to the exact answer (an improvement caused by a combination 
of the two points above).  The reanalysis of the data has led to only a 
slight change in the conclusions of the paper, specifically that the 
discrepency of the swap to ratio estimators is related to poor sampling 
statistics and *not* necessarily ergodicity breaking; the relevant parts 
of the text have been updated.  The general conclusions of the paper are 
unchanged, and in fact the applicability of this technique (in particular
the bare swap estimator) has been, if anything, increased.

In summary, we believe that our thourough consideration of referee
criticisms has significantly improved our manuscript, and therefore we
hope the referees and editor agree that publication in PRL is now
appropriate.

Below we outline a few more specific responses to referee queries.

These concerns are addressed in paragraph [1] above.  We have both rewritten 
equations (3) and (4) to improve clarity, and added this reference as [13]
in the revised manuscript.

We have considered carefully this point, and we have decided, in the
absence of a similar concern by referees A and C, not to lengthen the
introductory background and motivation, as we agree with the referee that
space limitations in PRL always limit the possible background information.
We refer the referee however to paragraph [2] above.

We have carefully considered and slightly changed the abstract.

We thank the referee for pointing this out.  The notation is used in the 
references, however we have clarified this by modifying the text under
Eq. (2), to say that (a,b) represents a valence bond between sites a and b. 

We note also that $\Psi_0$ is the ground state of the system, independent 
of basis.  We hope the new discussion (see paragraph [1] above) will 
clarify this.

This is addressed in paragraph [1]. We have modified eqn (3) to show the
SWAP operator acting on general states expressed as a linear combination
of product states.  These general states can have valence bonds between 
regions A and B and are therefore entangled, as illustrated in figure 1.

This is also addressed in paragraph [1].  We have significantly expanded
equations (3) and (4) to make the proof more understandable.

We hope that the comment that this paper may be "rather of specific interest" 
is addressed in paragraph [2].
