\begin{abstract} 
We develop a procedure for measuring the entanglement entropy of a subregion $A$ in a quantum
many-body system using valence-bond basis quantum Monte Carlo simulations.  Namely, an 
estimator for the Renyi entropy is related to the expectation of a unitary operator which swaps the 
basis states of a region $A$ with an ancillary copy of that region.  We outline an algorithm for 
calculating the Renyi entropy directly from this {\it Swap} operator, as well as an improved estimator
involving the ratio of {\it Swap} operators for different subregions.
We demonstrate that the Renyi entropy calculated for a Heisenberg chain  
converges to exact results provided by density matrix renormalization group calculations.  Finally, we 
calculate the scaling of the Renyi entropy in the two-dimensional Heisenberg model and confirm that the N\'eel 
groundstate obeys the expected area law.

{\it Introduction.}-- 
The measurement of entanglement in interacting quantum many-body systems has promised to provide
new tools and insights to the field of condensed-matter physics.  Most exciting are proposals to use 
entanglement as a probe to detect topological order, for example in paramagnetic spin liquids with no 
local order parameters, and fractional quantum hall states important in proposals for topologically protected qbits.  
A variety of measures of entanglement are used by the community, including fidelity, concurrence, and entropy;
however the latter is by far the most widely studied.  In most quantum systems in two dimensions (2D) and higher, the 
leading contribution to the entanglement entropy scales as the boundary of a subsystem $A$ -- the so-called
``area law''.  Important {\it universal} subleading corrections to this scaling are known to occur in topological phases, or 
in the presence of a quantum critical point.  Thus, the study of entanglement entropy promises to provide an important new 
window into the understanding of universal behavior, a uniting concept across broad fields of experimental and theoretical 
physics.

A major obstacle to date in the use of entanglement entropy as a resource for studying condensed-matter systems is 
the difficulty in calculating it in 2D and higher.
There are very few exactly-solvable systems, and no known simulation methods exist to date for calculating entanglement entropy numerically in $D>1$.
To understand this, consider the generalized Renyi entropy, defined as 
\begin{equation}
S_{n} (\rho_A) = \frac{1}{1- n} \ln \left[{ {\rm Tr}\big( \rho_A^{n} \big) }\right],
\label{Sn}
\end{equation}
where $\rho_A$ is the reduced-density matrix of a subregion $A$ entangled with its complement $B$, and 
$n>0$.  In the limit $n \rightarrow 1$, one recovers the formal 
definition of the familiar von Neumann entropy, $S_1 (\rho_A) = - {\rm Tr}( \rho_A \ln \rho_A )$.  The von Neumann entropy
is accessible numerically only in procedures where the reduced density matrix can be calculated directly, such as Lanczos 
or density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).  Scalable simulations methods in dimensions $D>1$, needed in order to study the groundstate, finite-temperature, and 
critical properties of the vast majority of systems of interest to condensed-matter physics, are so far essentially
restricted to quantum Monte Carlo (QMC).  However, the functional dependence of $\rho_A$ inside of the trace 
makes calculating $S_1$ difficult in QMC, where this trace is approximated by a Markov Chain calculated
through a Metropolis importance-sampling algorithm. 

Recently, the general Renyi entropies has recently attracted considerable attention, due to their ability to encode
information about the whole ``entanglement spectrum'' of $\rho_A$, together allowing the set of $S_{n}$ to contain 
much more information than $S_1$ alone \cite{Espec}.  For example, the concept of topological entanglement entropy has recently been
generalized to the family of Renyi entropies, where it has been shown to be equal to the logarithm of the total quantum 
dimension, $S_{\rm top} \propto \log {\mathcal D}$, independent of $n$ \cite{PI}.  Universal corrections to the scaling of $S_{n}$ 
have also recently been calculated in a field-theoretic treatment of the $O(N)$ model \cite{Max}.
In addition, it is useful to note that two Renyi entropies $S_{n}$ and $S_{m}$ obey the fundamental
inequality $S_{n} \geq S_{m}$ when $n > m$, making for example $S_2$ useful as a rigorous
lower bound on $S_1$.

In this paper we show that the Renyi entropy $S_2$ can be represented in the valence-bond basis as the expectation
value of a unitary swap operator.  This swap operator is directly accessible as a simple expectation value in a QMC simulation scheme
based on the valence-bond basis.  Using QMC simulations, we calculate the entropy $S_2$ for a $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model
in 1D and 2D lattices.  In 1D, we demonstrate that $S_2$ calculated with QMC converges to the exact result obtained with DMRG simulations.  In 2D, we show that the leading order term in the scaling of $S_2$ goes like the boundary of the region $A$, 
confirming the area law expected in the N\'eel groudstate from recent studies \cite{Ann}.

{\it Valence-bond basis and the Swap operator.}-- We briefly review the notation of Sandvik, and refer the reader to 
Refs.~\cite{Sandvik,AWSloop} for additional details on the valence bond basis.
We write the expansion of a singlet
wavefunction $\Psi$ of $N$ spins as $N/2$ valence bonds:
\begin{equation}
| \Psi \rangle = \sum_r f_r|(a^r_1,b^r_1) \ldots (a^r_{N/2},b^r_{N/2}) \rangle = \sum_r f_r| V_r \rangle
\end{equation}
where the valence bonds are singlet pairs denoted by $(a,b) = (\uparrow_a \downarrow_b - \downarrow_a \uparrow_b)/\sqrt{2}$,
occuring between sites of the opposite sublattices of a bipartite lattice, and $r$ labels all possible tilings of bonds.  The coefficients $f_r$ are unknown, but an importance sampling scheme \cite{Sandvik} for the valence bond state $| V_r \rangle$ will be outlined below.  

We now give an equivalent definition of
the Renyi entropy $S_2$ as the expectation
value of a swap operator on two copies of the system.  
%We first
%present a formal solution to the problem of measuring the entropy
%in QMC, Eq.~(\ref{ensembleavg}) below, as a QMC averge.
%We then explain how to better perform the statistical sampling for
%actual calculations.
Define an
operator $Swap_A$ which acts on two copies of the system, swapping the
configurations within region $A$.  To more precisely define the operator
$Swap_A$, we now write out its matrix elements in a product basis.
Let $|\alpha\rangle$  represent a complete basis of states in the complement region
$A$ and let $|\beta\rangle$ represent a complete basis of states in
region $B$.  Then, $|\alpha\rangle \otimes |\beta\rangle$ represent
a complete basis of states for the whole system, and
$\Bigl( |\alpha_1\rangle \otimes |\beta_1\rangle \Bigr) \otimes
\Bigl( |\alpha_2\rangle \otimes |\beta_2\rangle \Bigr)$
represent a complete basis of states for two copies of the system.
Define the operator $Swap_A$ by
\begin{eqnarray}
&& Swap_A \Bigl( |\alpha_1\rangle \otimes |\beta_1\rangle \Bigr) \otimes
\Bigl( |\alpha_2\rangle \otimes |\beta_2\rangle \Bigr) \nonumber \\ &&=
\Bigl( |\alpha_2\rangle \otimes |\beta_1\rangle \Bigr) \otimes
\Bigl( |\alpha_1\rangle \otimes |\beta_2\rangle \Bigr).
\end{eqnarray}
The operator $Swap_A$ is a unitary operator.
On immediately sees that the Renyi entropy is simply
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{H2fromSwap}
S_2(\rho_A) &=&-\ln(\langle \Psi\otimes \Psi|Swap_A|\Psi\otimes \Psi\rangle) \\
&=&-\ln(\langle Swap_A \rangle).
\end{eqnarray}
The $Swap_A$ operator is illustrated for a 1D lattice with six sites in Fig~\ref{swap_2}.  There, two copies of the system (``real'' and ``ancillary'') are
drawn before (a) and after (b) operation by the $Swap_A$ operator.  The result is an entangling of the valence bonds between the 
real and ancillary systems across the boundary of the region $A$.

{\it Measuring the Swap operator in QMC.}--
We now present a procedure for measuring the entropy $S_2$ via importance sampling of the $Swap_A$ operator in QMC.  A
projector scheme in the valence-bond basis has recently been poineered by Sandvik \cite{Sandvik}, and we only briefly
review the notation here, referring the reading to Refs.~\cite{Sandvik,AWSloop} for details of implementation.
In short, the method is a $T=0$ projector QMC, where high powers of
a Hamiltonian $H$ are used to project out the ground state $|0\rangle$ from a trial wavefunction, 
$(-H)^m|\Psi \rangle \propto |0\rangle$.  In Sandvik's QMC scheme, $(-H)^m$ is written as a sum of all products of $m$ bond
operators,
\begin{equation}
(-H)^m = \sum_r \prod_{i=1}^m H_{a_i^r b_i^r} = \sum_r P_r,
\end{equation}
where for simplicity we use the spin 1/2 Heisenberg model, defining $H=-\sum_{\langle a,b \rangle}H_{ab}$ and 
$H_{ab} = -({\bf S}_a \cdot {\bf S}_b - 1/4)$.  The operator string $P_r$ is sampled according to its weight, $W_r$, accrued upon
evolution of a trial valence-bond state $|V \rangle$ under projection:
\begin{equation}
P_r |V \rangle = W_r |V(r) \rangle.
\end{equation}
As shown in Ref.~\cite{Sandvik}, for the Heisenberg model, $W_r$ is simply related to the number of off-diagonal 
operations $m_{\rm off}$ in the projection, $W_r = 2^{-m_{\rm off}}$.

To sample the $Swap_A$ operator, one requires a double-projector valence-bond QMC scheme \cite{Sandvik}, where
a general expectation value for an observable $\mathcal{O}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{expect}
\langle \mathcal{O} \rangle = \frac{\sum_{rl} \langle V | P_l^* \mathcal{O} P_r | V \rangle} {\sum_{rl} \langle V | P_l^* P_r | V \rangle} 
= \frac{\sum_{rl} W_l W_r \langle V(l) | \mathcal{O} | V(r) \rangle} {\sum_{rl} W_l W_r \langle V(l) | V(r) \rangle}
\end{equation} 
This expectation value can be applied directly to the $Swap_A$ operator, illustrated in Fig.~\ref{swap_2}.  Namely, one 
performs important sampling of operator strings according to the weight $W_l W_r \langle V(l) | V(r) \rangle$, and measures
the QMC average expectation value
\begin{equation}
\langle Swap_A \rangle =  \left\langle{ \frac{ \langle V(l) | Swap_A | V(r) \rangle}{\langle V(l) | V(r) \rangle}  }\right\rangle 
\label{Swap}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure} {
\includegraphics[width=3in]{L100_fig2.eps} \caption{(color online)

data labelled $j_{\rm max}=5$ was calculated with Eq.~\ref{Ratio} using 19 separate simulations with a range of  $j \in [1,5]$.  The inset shows the convergence of $S_2$ to the exact value (dashed line) with $x=6$ up to $m=4000$.
}
} \end{figure}

Results for a 1D chain are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{1Dfig}.  There, simulations were performed using a simple double-projector QMC,  where
the trial state $| V \rangle$ is a columnar state.  In the following data, four random bond operators were changed per Monte Carlo step, and unless otherwise
stated $m=40N$.  Exact results for $S_2(\rho_A)$ were obtained with a DMRG simulation, converged with 1000 states.  One 
immediately sees that the naive expectation value $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ results in a grossly incorrect result when the region
$A$ grows large (in 1D, $A$ is the linear region of size $x$).   
One may understand this incorrect result by considering the expected ``area law' scaling of $S_2$.  
Namely,we expect that in 2D and higher, $S_2(\rho_A)$ will be proportional to the {\it surface area} of the region
$A$; in 1D critical systems, such as the Heisenberg chain, it
may be even larger, of order the log of the size of $A$.  Thus,
the expectation value $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ should be exponentially small in the
surface area of $A$.  Once $A$ becomes
large (in 1D or higher), we are computing a very small quantity and
statistical fluctuations  will become important.
%(it is not clear whether or not the numerator in the average
%of (\ref{ensembleavg}) should be positive for every given realization,
%though maybe it is; even if it is positive for every realization,
%so that we are averaging a positive quantity, 
%the fact that the expectation
%of $Swap_A$ is so small means that we are doing the importance sampling
%incorrectly, since then only very few configurations contribute much to this
%expectation value.
In fact, for $x > 25$ in Fig.~\ref{1Dfig}, the Renyi entropy calculated with Eq.~\eqref{Swap} develops a discrepancy from the
exact value that cannot be accounted for by statistical fluctuations (error bars are one standard deviation).  The expectation 
value of $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ is apparently so low that simulation ergodicity is jeopardized; there are only very
few configurations contributing significantly to this expectation value, so the importance sampling is in practice done incorrectly.

To combat this issue, we propose a refinement to the algorithm, which we called ``improved ratio'' sampling.
Consider first a one-dimensional chain, and define regions $A^1,A^2,...,A^n$, such
that $A^i$ contains $i$ sites, and $A^i$ is a subset of $A^{i+1}$.  In other words, each region $A^{i+1}$ is obtained by adding one site to region
$A^{i}$, and region $A^0$ is the empty set (thus, $Swap_{A^0}$ is equal to the identity operator).
In a given simulation, one can calculate the ratio
\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle Swap_{A^{i+1}}\rangle}{\langle Swap_{A^{i}}\rangle}
= \frac{\sum_{rl} W_l W_r \langle V(l) | Swap_{A^{i+1}} | V(r) \rangle} {\sum_{rl} W_l W_r \langle V(l) | Swap_{A^i} | V(r) \rangle}
\label{Ratio}
\end{equation}
where, for each $i=0,...,n-1$, the log of this ratio is equal to minus the difference $S_2(\rho_{A^{i+1}})-S_2(\rho_{A^{i}})$.
Computing this ratio for each $i$ will let us compute $S_2$ for all $A^i$.  To calculate this ratio, the simulation must be performed 
with the modified sampling weight,
\begin{equation}
W_l W_r \langle V(l) | Swap_{A^i} | V(r) \rangle,
\end{equation}
i.e., a unique QMC simulation must be done for each desired $i$.  Thus, our simple double-projector algorithm, which scales 
approximately as $~{\rm max}(m^2, N)$ \cite{AWSloop}, obtains an additional multiplicative factor of $N$ in the scaling.  In practice, 
this can be reduced by noting that good statistical control can be retained by calculating 
${\langle Swap_{A^{i+j}}\rangle}/{\langle Swap_{A^{i}}\rangle}$ for fixed $i$ and a range of $j \in [1,j_{\max}]$.  We illustrate this in Fig.~\ref{1Dfig},
where simulations with $j_{\rm max}=5$ are sufficient to converge 100-site chain to the exact results along most of its length.

{\it 2D Heisenberg Results.}-- We now extend these concepts to QMC simulations of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg model on $N=L \times L$ lattices.  We define the entangled region $A$ as a square region of linear length $\ell$ encompassing $\ell \times \ell$ sites.  We calculate the expectation value of both $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ (Eq.~\ref{Swap}) directly using one simulation, as well as the improved ratio estimator ${\langle Swap_{A^{\ell+r}}\rangle}/{\langle Swap_{A^{\ell}}\rangle}$.  Here, both $\ell$ and $r$ are variables denoting the linear dimension of $A$; i.e. $A^{\ell+r}$ contains $2(\ell+r)$ more sites than $A^{\ell}$.

\begin{figure} {
\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{L8n12_ratio.eps} \caption{(color online)

The Renyi entropy divided by the linear dimension $\ell$ of the entangled region $A$, for 2D lattices with $L=8$ and $L=12$.  The data labelled ``Swap'' is from a single simulation calculating Eq.~\eqref{Swap} directly.  The other
data sets are derived from the improved ratio estimator, Eq.~\eqref{Ratio}, with different ranges of $r \in [1,r_{\rm max}]$ (see text).  The inset 
is a periodic $L=8$ lattice with region $A$ consisting of the 16 central (dark) sites labelled by $\ell = 4$.
}
} \end{figure}

Figure \ref{L16fig} illustrates $S_2$ on two 2D Heisenberg models with  $L=8$ and  $L=12$.  In the case of $L=8$, data for a single 
simulation calculating $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ directly is identical to the improved ratio estimators for all except the largest $\ell$.  
Here, the direct estimator (Eq~\eqref{Swap}) corresponds to one simulation, whereas $r_{\rm max}=1$ corresponds to 6 different simulations of the ratio estimator ${\langle Swap_{A^{\ell+1}}\rangle}/{\langle Swap_{A^{\ell}}\rangle}$ and $\ell \in [1,6]$.
In contrast to $L=8$, for $L=12$ the direct  $\langle Swap_A \rangle$ estimator is significantly different than 
the improved ratio estimator.  We can see the convergence of the data as one successively decreases the range of $r \in [1,r_{\rm max}]$, 
so that $r_{\rm max}=2$ is converged to be identical to $r_{\rm max}=1$, which is the smallest possible range to increment the 
improved ratio estimator in the 2D geometry illustrated.  It is important to note that for large $r_{\rm max}$ the correct value of $S_2$ does {\it not} lie within the error bars of the data.  
%This is an indication that the algorithm will not converge to the expected result in polynomial time, since the expectation value is exponentially decreasing.
This is an indication that simulation ergodicity is jeopardized by low sampling of the $Swap$ operator, similar to that observed in 1D.

}
} \end{figure}

We use the improved ratio estimator with $r_{\max}=1$ to scale the results for the Renyi entropy of the Heisenberg model to larger system sizes in 2D.  Results are given in Fig.~\ref{fig4} for $L=4$ to $L=28$, plotted as $S_2/\ell$.  From  Ref.~\cite{Ann}
one expects the scaling of $S_1$ in the N\'eel state to obey the area law; also recall that $S_2 \leq S_1$.  
The data illustrated is clearly consistent with the area law $S_2/\ell \sim {\rm const.}$ for $\ell<<L$, at which point boundary 
effects likely become important.  In particular, multiplicative log corrections (which were apparent in similar system sizes and geometries for the Valence-Bond Entanglement Entropy
\cite{Alet,Chh}) are not present.
