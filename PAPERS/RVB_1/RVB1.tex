\begin{abstract} 
We show that the entanglement entropy of several two-dimensional
gapless systems contains a logarithmic term that depends 
on the relative size of the entangled region.
Precisely, we show that the Renyi entropy between two
regions of length $x$ and $L-x$ extending around a cylinder of length
$L$ depends on $\ln(\sin(\pi x/L))$. This logarithmic term is thus
akin to that appearing in 1D systems with conformal symmetry. We
illustrate this with numerical results on the Heisenberg model with
N\'eel order, a free Dirac fermion, and the nearest-neighbor RVB wave
function.

\maketitle

{\it Introduction.} It is now well established that the low-energy physics of certain one-dimensional (1D) quantum many-body systems can be described by relativistic 1+1 dimensional field theories.  This correspondence occurs at quantum critical points, where in addition to scale invariance, quantum systems may enjoy {\it conformal} invariance.  In 1D, this has allowed classification of quantum critical points via the appropriate 1+1 dimensional conformal field theory (CFT): in particular the central charge $c$ describing the CFT.
In the cases where it is not known exactly (in integrable models), 
this central charge can be obtained directly in numerical measurements of the Renyi entanglement entropy,
$
S_n = 1/(1-n) \ln \big[ {\rm Tr} \rho_A^n \big],
$
(where region $A$ is entangled with its complement, region $B$), which have become commonplace in simulations using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG).  In particular, the
scaling of the Renyi entropy at a 1D critical system, with total length $L$ and length of region $A$ being $x$, obeys
\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{c}{6}\left({ \frac{1}{1+n} }\right) \ln\Big[ \frac{L}{\pi} \sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big) \Big]. \label{1Dcft}
\end{equation}
Numerical measurement of entanglement entropy via Eq.~\ref{1Dcft} has become the gold standard for identifying $c$ --
allowing access to the most important universal signature of the underlying CFT in one simple measurement.

In higher dimensions, the relationship between entanglement entropy and universal quantities is less concrete.  Although conformal invariance exists at scale-invariant critical points in the presence of translational and rotational symmetry, the breaking of these symmetries in physical systems can make the critical points non-conformal.  Arguments exit that logarithms similar to Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}) should emerge due to some asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance in higher-dimensional gapless models, although counter examples are known.  This nonetheless often leads to the hope that a logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy can be used to define an ``effective'' central charge for non-conformally invariant systems that may contain universal physics (or the equivalent of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem in higher-dimensions).
However, as Calabrese and Cardy caution, basic scaling relationships of higher-dimensional systems need to be carefully checked before
arguments about asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance are advanced.

Such checks became possible only recently, with the development of measurement techniques for accessing Renyi entropies in scalable quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods.  Since its inception in 2010, simulations employing this advance have confirmed the presence of universal subleading corrections to the area-law in topologically-ordered systems, as well as preliminary confirmations of area-law (and subleading logarithms) in the simple gapless 2D N\'eel state.  In this paper, we preform a careful finite-size scaling analysis of Renyi entropies in a specific cornerless geometry in several gapless wavefunctions.  We show, in addition to the additive logarithms identified in Ref.~XXX, we observe the emergence of a ``chord length'' scaling term, which depends on the width of the region $A$, reminiscent of Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}) for a 1D CFT.

Using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques we simulate both the Heisenberg ground state and the resonating valence bond (RVB) wavefunction in two dimensions (2D). 
The Heisenberg ground state is projected from a trial state by applying a high power of the Hamiltonian, via QMC in the valence bond (VB) basis.\cite{Sandvik_VBQMC}
The VB operators act to reorganize the bonds while effectively penalizing states with longer bonds.
The RVB wavefunction contains all possible combinations of only nearest-neighbor VBs in an equal superpositions.
The RVB QMC algorithm does a random walk through the possible states by creating a defect at some point and propagating it through the system (thereby rearranging the nearest-neighbor bonds) until the defect reaches the initial point and its path forms a closed loop.

If we visualize the Heisenberg ground state in this VB language, then the RVB wavefunction is its largest component, the remainder of the state being equal superpositions with longer bonds decaying as $1/r^3$ \cite{Sandvik_VB_decay} with the length of the bonds.

For both these systems (Heisenberg and RVB) we use a square lattice torus geometry and measure the entanglement for two different types of region $A$:
a $square$ region $A$ containing four corners, and a $strip$ region $A$ (like a slice of the torus) which has no corners and constant boundary length $\ell$ for a given $L$ by $L$ system.
We denote with width of each of these regions by $x$, where a square will have dimensions $x$ by $x$ and a strip will be $x$ by $L$ when it is embedded in an $L$ by $L$ system.

In Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}} we illustrate QMC results for the N\'eel state, first explored in Ref.~[XXX].  In that work, the presence of an area law term $\propto \ell$ was confirmed, as well as a subleading logarithmic term $\propto \ln(\ell)$ (present, surprisingly, even with an absence of corners in the region $A$).  This subleading term was extracted when the width of the region $A$, $x = L/2$, is equivalent to the ``center'' of each curve in Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}}.  As is apparent, this choice of region $A$ removes the $x$-dependence of each curve.  This can be remedied
by the scaling ansatz
\begin{align}
S_2(L) &= a(L) \ell + b(L) \ln(\ell) \nonumber \\
&+ c(L) \ln \left[{ \sin\left({ \frac{\pi x}{L} }\right) }\right] + d(L) \label{Fit}
\end{align}
{\color{red} which we use to fit {\it all} data individually for each system size $L$. }
% 1.  Do we fit all the data individually with this full function?
% 2.  If so that put "each data set individually" if not then "all data simultaneously"
It is clear in Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}} that this form gives an excellent fit to the data for all $x$ and $L$, providing strong evidence for the presence of the chord length.  We can analyze the fits further by examining the dependence of the coefficients on system size $L$.  Most interestingly, we observe the coefficient of the chord-length increasing with $L$, as illustrated in the inset of Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}}.

We next examine the scaling of the Renyi entropy in the RVB wavefunction, illustrated in Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}.  As apparent in the inset for $L=24$, there exists a more complicated structure to the entropies than in the N\'eel state: the appearance of two branches, an ``upper branch'' when $x$ is odd, and a ``lower branch'' when $x$ is even.  The precise source of the two branches is not known, although simple counting arguments of prototypical valence-bond configurations in the (0,0) topological sector may hint at their existence since the number of valence-bonds crossing from region $A$ to region $B$ alternates strongly with $x$.  Even from this $L=24$ curve there is a clear $x$-dependent curve in each branch: this can be analyzed more closely by examining one branch and attempting fits of the form Eq.~(\ref{Fit}).  In the main plot of Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}, it is clear that fits to the scaling ansatz for the lower branch are excellent.  Examining the $L$-dependence of the fit coefficients shows that, like in the N\'eel state, the coefficient of the chord length increases with increasing system size.
