\begin{abstract} 
We numerically determine universal terms in the entanglement entropy of several two dimensional (2D) gapless systems, including a Heisenberg model with N\'eel order, a free Dirac fermion in the $\pi$-flux phase, and the nearest-neighbor resonating-valence bond wave function.
For these models, we show that the entanglement entropy between \textcolor{blue}{cylindrical}
regions of length $x$ and $L-x$, extending around a torus of
length $L$, depends upon the dimensionless ratio $x/L$, and can be well-approximated on finite-size lattices by a function
$\ln(\sin(\pi x/L))$, akin to the familiar chord-length dependence in one dimension.

{\it Introduction.} 
The study of quantum condensed matter systems
%, long studied with a host of probes related to energy spectrum, broken symmetry,
%and fluctuations,
 is now benefitting from an infusion of ideas related to quantum information and entanglement. The importance of this new resource is most strikingly 
demonstrated in the study of entanglement entropy at one-dimensional (1D) quantum critical points with conformal invariance. Conformal field theory (CFT) provides an important
universal number, the {\it central charge} $c$, that appears in an astonishing array of physical
quantities \cite{Cardyubiquitous}. A given CFT, and
thus any quantum critical points it describes, can be
characterized by this number.
%Moreover, a profound result, Zamolodchikov's
%$c$-theorem, indicates that $c$ cannot increase in
%renormalization-group flows \cite{Zamo}. 
Its numerical or analytical determination provides an invaluable tool in identifying which, if any, CFT describes a given Hamiltonian. 
%Namely, since it appears in
%various physical quantities, it can be measured numerically, and then
%compared with the central charges of the (many) known
%CFTs. 
The central charge can be numerically determined in 1D quantum systems by analyzing the finite-size spectrum \cite{BCN,Affleck}, but this is a formidable task: not only is $c$ a subleading contribution to the ground state energy, but extracting it also requires the knowledge of the velocity.
%
%More recently, a more direct method very amenable to numerical
%simulation has been utilized.  
However,  the central charge also can be extracted 
directly from the ground-state wavefunction by measuring its Renyi
entanglement entropy, $ S_n = 1/(1-n) \ln \big[ {\rm Tr} \rho_A^n
\big], $ where region $A$ is entangled with its complement, region
$B$ \cite{Holzhey, VidalC}.  In particular, in a system with total length $L$ and the connected region $A$ being of length $x$, the scaling of the Renyi entropy in 1D critical systems depends on the ``chord length" and central charge as \cite{Korepin,Cardy},
%
%In particular, the scaling of the Renyi entropy in 1D critical systems,
%with total length $L$ and length of region $A$ being $x$, obeys a ``chord-length''  \cite{Korepin,Cardy},
\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{c}{6}\left({1+ \frac{1}{n} }\right) \ln\Big[ \frac{L}{\pi} \sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big) \Big]. \label{1Dcft}
\end{equation}
%\sout{Here, $c$ appears as the coefficient of the leading term.  }
Due to this result, numerical measurements of entanglement entropy have become commonplace and 
very accurate, e.g.\ in simulations using the density matrix renormalization group. This has made
Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}) the gold standard for identifying $c$.


In higher dimensions, the scaling behavior of the
entanglement entropy is much less well understood.  Ground states of local Hamiltonians
are generally believed to produce an ``area-law'' (i.e.\ boundary) scaling \cite{ALreview}, the subleading corrections
to which may be universal quantities that can be used to identify and characterize
quantum phases and phase transitons.
The most well established of these is the {\it topological entanglement entropy} 
\cite{Alioscia1,Alioscia2,KP,LW} of a gapped state with topological order.
In gapless states, the subleading corrections, although still potentially harboring universal 
quantities, become more complicated. \textcolor{blue}{
The best-understood results apply to a special situation, when the ground state itself is written in terms of a two-dimensional CFT  \cite{Hsu08,Misguich}.}
In the presence of a spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, it has been found that Goldstone modes 
produce a subleading bulk logarithmic correction \cite{HeisLog,MaxLog}.
Subleading logarithms from corner contributions with universal coefficients are also predicted to occur at critical points \cite{Moore06,logcorner,Max}.
%In higher dimensions, the relationship between entanglement entropy
%and universal quantities is less concrete.  Although conformal
%invariance exists at scale-invariant critical points in the presence
%of translational and rotational symmetry, the breaking of these
%symmetries in physical systems can make the critical points
%non-conformal.  Moreover, even if conformal, precisely which quantity
%in general to identify as a central charge is an open question.
It is possible that the presence of logarithmic scaling can be used to define an ``effective'' central
charge for non-conformally invariant systems in two spatial dimensions (2D). % that may contain
%universal physics (or perhaps even the equivalent of the $c$-theorem
%in higher-dimensions \cite{ryu,Myers}).  
%Arguments exist that logarithms similar to Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}) should emerge due to some
%asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance in higher-dimensional
%gapless models \cite{Shredder} (although counter examples are known).  
However, as Calabrese and Cardy caution, basic scaling relationships of
higher-dimensional systems need to be carefully checked \textcolor{green}{before
arguments about asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance are
advanced} \cite{EE_CFT}.

In this paper, we study numerically the scaling of the second Renyi entropy for the ground states of several 2D gapless systems. \textcolor{blue}{Gapless modes can have long-range entanglement, so one expects the entanglement entropy to depend on the size and shape of the regions $A$ and $B$. To probe this, we utilize a corner-free geometry that also makes it possible to vary the size of regions $A$ and $B$ without changing the length of the boundary between them. Namely, our 2D space is a torus, while $A$ and $B$ are cylinders.}
We examine finite-size scaling of the Renyi entropy in the gapless N\'eel state, and the nearest-neighbor resonating-valence-bond (RVB) wavefunction
on the 2D square lattice, using quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations.
In addition to the subleading logarithm identified in Refs.~\cite{HeisLog,MaxLog},
we observe the emergence of a shape-dependent scaling function that closely mimics the chord-length contribution in 1D CFT finite-size systems in Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}).
To probe this behavior in a simpler system, we study
a free spinless fermion in the $\pi$-flux phase, and find that the entanglement scaling has a universal shape-dependent piece as well.
For finite-size systems, this closely mimics the chord length, but in the infinite-size limit we observe it to cross over to a different non-trivial function.
Among other consequences, this shape-dependent term will give a non-zero signature in the entanglement quantities \cite{KP,LW} designed to look for topological order, which implies that a straightforward generalization of a topological entanglement entropy will not be possible in gapless spin-liquid states.

%Since the terms in the Renyi entropy with
%universal behavior are subleading in $d>1$, it has only recently become
%possible to measure them accurately through the development of measurement
%techniques in scalable quantum Monte
%Carlo (QMC) methods \cite{swap,XXZ}.  Simulations employing this advance
%have confirmed the presence of universal subleading corrections to the
%area-law in topologically-ordered systems \cite{isakov}, as well as preliminary
%confirmations of area-law (and subleading logarithms) in the simple
%gapless 2D N\'eel state \cite{HeisLog}. %>>> Misguich should be mentioned too, they've been doing this for a while???.  
%In this paper, we perform a careful
%finite-size scaling analysis of Renyi entropies in a specific
%cornerless geometry in several gapless wavefunctions \cite{Misguich}. 

{\it Fermions with $\pi$-flux---}
%Before presenting the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis of more complicated models, we begin with a more tractable case, a free fermion model.
We begin by considering a tractable case of
free spinless fermions on a square lattice, with $\pi$-flux through each plaquette.  We consider a torus of size $L_x$ by $L_y$, and
measure the entanglement % for two different types of region $A$: a $square$ region $A$ containing four corners, and 
using a cornerless \textcolor{blue}{cylindrical} region $A$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:torus}) with a constant boundary length $\ell = 2L_y$.
We denote the width of region $A$ by $x$. % \sout{and $L = \ell/2$}.
%, where a square will have dimensions $x$ by $x$ and a strip will be $x$ by $L$ when it is embedded in an $L$ by $L$ system.
Using translational invariance in the $y$-direction, it is possible to simulate large systems.  This system has Dirac points near momentum $k_y=0$ and $k_y=\pi$.  We take anti-periodic boundary conditions in the $x$-direction so that there will be no exact zero mode.

We claim that the entanglement entropy of such a system is given by
\be
S_n \sim {\rm const.}\times \ell /a + F(x/L_x,L_y/L_x),
\ee
where the constant is non-universal and the function $F$ is a universal scaling function of the dimensionless ratios.  A crucial difference
from the result in one dimension, Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}), is that the lattice scale appears in the first non-universal term but does not appear in the universal function, $F$.  In contrast, the one-dimensional result can be written as a sum of two terms as
$S_n =C \ln[\sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big)]+ C\ln[\frac{L}{\pi}] $, where $C=c/(6(1+n))$.
The first term is a universal function of the dimensionless ratio $x/L$, akin to the function $F$ above, while the second term involves the lattice scale, as it diverges with $L$.

To illustrate the absence of such an ``additive logarithm" (a logarithmic divergence depending on $L$ divided by lattice scale) in 2D, \textcolor{blue}{we treat this free system as a collection of independent systems in 1D labeled by the momenta $k_y$.}
%consider the two-dimensional entropy as a sum of one-dimensional entropies of systems with different momenta, $k_y$.  
The $k_y=0$ mode contributes an additive logarithm $C \ln(L_x)$ to the entropy.  The modes with small $k_y \neq 0$ contribute additive logarithms $C \ln(k_y^{-1})$. Summing over $k_y=2\pi n/L_y$, this gives an entropy $C \big( \ln(L_x)+2\sum_{n=1}^{n \sim L_y} \ln(L_y/2 \pi n) \big)=C\ln(L_x) + 2 C\ln((L_y/2\pi)^{L_y}/L_y!)$, where the factor of $2$ arises from summing over positive and negative $n\neq 0$.  Using Stirlings formula for $L_y!$, one finds that the additive logarithm terms add to $C(\ln(L_x)-\ln(L_y))=C\ln(L_x/L_y)$. This can be absorbed into the scaling function $F$, so that there is no additive logarithm.  A more precise calculation would include the effect of a finite $L_x$ for these modes, but we can ignore this here as our only goal is to show the cancellation of additive logarithms. A similar calculation near $k_y=\pi$ leads to a cancellation of the additive logarithm there.


The entropy of a given $k_y$ mode contains, in addition to the additive logarithmic divergence in $k_y$, a universal scaling function $G(x/L_x,k_y x)$.  At $k_y=0$, we see the chord-length scaling $C \ln\sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big)$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:dirac}), but for $k_y \neq 0$ and for $k_y x$ large, the chord-length scaling disappears and the entropy becomes roughly flat as a function of $x/L$.  In fact, for $L_y=L_x=L$, the lowest $k_y$ mode has a mass $2 k_y=4\pi/L$, and hence the entropy of that mode is flat for a large range of $x/L$.  As a result, for $L_y=L_x=L$, the entropy of the two dimensional system appears to display 1D chord length scaling over a wide range of $x/L_x$.

{\it Quantum Monte Carlo---}
Using QMC techniques we simulate both the
Heisenberg ground state and the RVB
wavefunction in 2D.  The Heisenberg ground state is
projected from a trial state by applying a high power of the
Hamiltonian, $H = \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} {\bf S}_i \cdot {\bf S}_j$, via a QMC method operating in the valence bond (VB)
basis \cite{Sandvik}. %The Hamiltonian operators act to reorganize the
%bonds while effectively penalizing states with longer bonds.  
\textcolor{blue}{The RVB wavefunction 
is an equal-amplitude superposition 
%\begin{equation}
$| \Psi \rangle = \sum_{\alpha} | V_{\alpha} \rangle$
%\end{equation}
of all nearest-neighbor valence-bond states 
\begin{equation}
|V_{\alpha} \rangle =  \frac{1}{2^{N/4}} \prod_{i=1}^{N/2} \big( | \uparrow_i \downarrow_{j_{\alpha}} \rangle -  | \downarrow_i  \uparrow_{j_{\alpha}} \rangle \big)
\end{equation}
 defined by requiring that each spin $i$ on one sublattice be in a singlet with one of its neighbors $j_\alpha$}  \cite{RVB1,RVB2}. The RVB 
Monte Carlo sampling
algorithm does a random walk through the possible states by creating a
defect at some spatial point and propagating it through the system (thereby
rearranging the nearest-neighbor bonds) until the defect reaches the
initial point and its path forms a closed loop \cite{AWSloop}.
If we visualize the Heisenberg ground state in this VB language, then the RVB wavefunction is its largest component, the remainder of the state being equal superpositions with longer bonds decaying with the length of the bonds as $1/r^3$ \cite{Sandvik}. \textcolor{blue}{Likewise, the RVB wavefunction is the ground state of a local (but longer-range) Hamiltonian that includes a Heisenberg term \cite{Cano}.}


We consider the same geometry as for the $\pi$-flux fermions, with $L_x=L_y=L$ (see Fig.~\ref{fig:torus}).

 \end{figure}
In Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_bow}}, we illustrate QMC results for the Renyi entropy in the N\'eel and RVB states on a $24 \times 24$ torus.  
Several features of the entanglement scaling are clear from this plot.  First, note that the data for the N\'eel state has a significant curvature as a function of $x$.  \textcolor{blue}{This curvature was first seen in Ref.~\cite{HeisLog} but not explored in detail. (Instead by studying the behavior at fixed $x/L$ a surprising subleading logarithmic term $\propto \ln(\ell)$ was found.)}
%is present, surprisingly, even with an absence of corners in the region $A$ \cite{MaxLog}.
%N\'eel state, first explored in Ref.~\cite{HeisLog}.  In that work, the presence of an area law term $\propto \ell$ was confirmed, as well as a subleading logarithmic term $\propto \ln(\ell)$ (present, surprisingly, even with an absence of corners in the region $A$).  This subleading term was extracted when the width of the region $A$, $x = L/2$, is equivalent to the ``center'' of each curve in Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_bow}}.  
There is significant curvature in the $x$ dependence of the RVB wave function as well  (Fig.~\ref{fig:heis_bow}).  However, here there exists a more complicated structure to the entropies: the appearance of two branches (an ``odd branch'' when $x$ is odd, and an ``even branch'' when $x$ is even).  We discuss this branching structure in more detail below.

To capture the $x$-dependent curvature of these wavefunctions, we fit the data with the scaling ansatz
\begin{align}
S_2= a \ell + b\ln(\ell)
+ c(L) \ln \left[{ \sin\left({ \frac{\pi x}{L} }\right) }\right] + d \label{Fit})
\end{align}
motivated by the chord length in Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}).
We begin by examining the N\'eel state in Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_lines}}.  For a fixed linear system size $L$, plots of $S_2$ versus $ \ln \left[{ \sin\left({ \frac{\pi x}{L} }\right) }\right] $ would yield a straight line if Eq.~(\ref{Fit}) were obeyed perfectly.  
One could speculate that the apparent chord-length scaling of these square-lattice 2D systems is actually not perfectly obeyed in the thermodynamic limit, and that this fact is manifest in slight deviations from straight-line behavior in Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_lines}}(a).
This would be a similar scenario to the deviation from chord-length scaling observed for $\pi$-flux fermions in Fig.~\ref{fig:dirac}.  
However, it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion regarding the statistical significance of any deviation from Eq.~(\ref{Fit}) scaling in our
present data, due to limited system sizes and stochastic error.

   \scalebox{1}{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figs/heis.pdf}}

   \caption{(a)Heisenberg data and linear fits (excluding the first two data points on the left) for $L=14,16,\dots,30$ plotted in terms of the log of the ``chord-length", $\ln\left[\sin \frac{\pi x}{L}\right]$.
   (b) Slopes of the fits, $c(L)$, exhibit a strong dependence on the system size, $L$.
   }
   \label{fig:heis_lines}
 \end{figure}

%In fact, as is visible in the largest $L$ considered, there is a slight deviation of the straight-line fits for small $x$.  
We can however further examine the deviation from conformal-style scaling by examining the universality of the 
coefficient of the chord-length in the N\'eel state.
To do this, we extract the $L$-dependence of the coefficient $c(L)$ in Eq.~(\ref{Fit}).  As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:heis_lines}(b),
the coefficient does not approach a constant for the system sizes that we have studied, rather is has some functional dependence on $L$.
This functional dependence is apparently sub-linear.  It is interesting to speculate that $c(L) \sim L^p$ with $p\leq1$.  A rigorous analysis of the data along this lines is impossible however within the current
accuracy of our QMC simulations.

%It is clear in that this form gives an excellent fit to the data for all $x$ and $L$, providing strong evidence for the presence of the chord length.  We can analyze the fits further by examining the dependence of the coefficients on system size $L$.  Most interestingly, we observe the coefficient of the chord-length increasing with $L$, as illustrated in the inset of Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}}.

   \caption{(a) Even and (b) odd branches of the second Renyi entropy plotted against the log of the ``chord-length". We exclude $x=1,2$ data from the plots, as there is some crossover behavior observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:heis_bow}. (c) The slopes, $c(L)$, as a function of the system size, $L$. As with the Heisenberg, there is a strong dependence on $L$.}
   \label{fig:2}
 \end{figure}

We next examine the scaling of the Renyi entropy in the RVB wavefunction, illustrated in Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}.  
As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:heis_bow}, a very striking two-branch structure exists, depending on whether the distance $x$ is even or odd. \textcolor{blue}{
The presence of the two branches presumably is related to the fact that correlators in the RVB state have a pronounced even-odd dependence. Moreover,} simple counting arguments of prototypical valence-bond configurations in the (0,0) topological sector \cite{RVB1,RVB2} show that the number of valence bonds crossing from region $A$ to region $B$ alternates strongly with $x$.  From this $L=24$ data there is a clear $x$-dependent curvature in each branch: this can be analyzed more closely by examining each branch individually and attempting fits of the form Eq.~(\ref{Fit}).  

In Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}(a) and (b), it is clear that fits to the scaling ansatz to both branches are quite accurate when the extremal values of $x$ are excluded.   Unfortunately, due to the two-branch structure of the Renyi entropy in the RVB wavefunction, each curve on this plot has essentially half the usable data than the analagous Heisenberg data in Fig.~\ref{fig:heis_lines}.  Nonetheless, we can attempt to extract the size-dependence of the coefficient $c$ in a similar manner.  The result (Fig.~\ref{fig:2}(c)) shows that a significant $L$-dependence again seems to exists in the RVB wavefunction.  This may again suggest that, although the fit of individual $L$ data to a chord-length scaling is consistent within the accuracy of our data, subtle corrections to this form may come into play in the 2D thermodynamic limit.

{\it Discussion---} \textcolor{blue}{We have studied the Renyi entanglement entropy for the ground state of three gapless systems on $L_x\times L_y$ toroidal lattices with the subregion $A$ a cylinder of length $x$, and 
demonstrated that it contains a scaling term $F(x/L_x,L_y/L_x)$. This term is subleading to the area law and depends on bulk quantities, namely the dimensionless aspect ratios of the subregion and the lattice linear dimensions.}

 \textcolor{blue}{Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Heisenberg N\'eel groundstate and the short-range RVB wavefunction with $L_x=L_y=L$ show an almost-perfect dependence of $F$ on the chord length $\sin(\pi x/L)$.}
It appears that the coefficient of this term is not a universal constant, however, which might suggest that care must be taken the order of limits with which the thermodynamic limit is approached. \textcolor{blue}{A study of the crossover from one to two dimensions might also illuminate this issue further.}  Further evidence that the true 2D scaling function might be more complicated than the chord-length form is given by the scaling of gapless Dirac fermions in the $\pi$-flux phase, for which we've argued that such scaling is superseded by a build of up transverse modes leading to a different (unknown) functional form in 2D.  Further,  spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg model may complicate measurement of the entanglement entropy, and current simulations are unable to completely characterize the scaling behavior of these terms in the Heisenberg and RVB models at large sizes.

Regardless of the precise functional form of $F(x/L_x,L_y/L_x)$, its general existence in gapless wavefunctions in 2D would have some profound consequences.  
Most immediate may be the complications that arise while attempting to use entanglement as a probe to detect gapless spin liquids, since it gives a clear non-zero signature in the quantities used to define the topological entanglement entropy \cite{KP,LW}.
%Most immediate may be it's complication of attempts to use entanglement to detect gapless spin liquids,

In addition, the similarity of the scaling function to a chord-length (present in 1D conformally invariant systems) 
raises the \textcolor{green}{tantalizing possibility that it maybe be related to arguments promoting the asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance in higher-dimensional gapless models} \cite{Shredder}.  
\textcolor{blue}{Indeed, since the search for a $c$-theorem \cite{Zamo} valid in higher dimensions is of intense interest across several disparate field of physics (see e.g.\ \cite{Cardy88,ryu,Myers,Komargodski}),
we hope our results inspire a broader examination of the existence of this scaling term in two-dimensional gapless states.}
