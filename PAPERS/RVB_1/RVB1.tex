\begin{abstract} 
We numerically determine universal terms in the entanglement entropy of two dimensional gapless systems, including a Heisenberg model with
N\'eel order, a free Dirac fermion, and the nearest-neighbor resonating-valence
bond wave function.
For a variety of different models, we show that the entanglement entropy between regions of length $x$ and $L-x$ extending around a torus of
length $L$ depends upon the dimensionless ratio $x/L$ and can be well-approximated in many settings by a function of the ``chord length",
$\ln(\sin(\pi x/L))$, akin to the result in one dimension.
We consider the role of torus aspect ratio and we find that an additive logarithmic divergence in $L/a$, where $a$ is the lattice scale, appears in some models but not others.

{\it Introduction.} Quantum condensed matter systems, long studied with a host of probes related to energy spectrum, order parameters, correlation functions and similar, are now clearly benefitting from a infusion of ideas related to quantum information and entanglement.
This paradigm is highlighted best with the study of entanglement entropy scaling.  

The importance of this new resource was most strikingly 
demonstrated in the study of conformally-invariant 1D quantum critical points.
%It is now well established that the low-energy
%physics of many one-dimensional (1D) quantum many-body systems can be
%described by relativistic 1+1 dimensional field theories.  This
%correspondence is common at quantum critical points, 
%where in addition
%to scale invariance, quantum systems may enjoy {\it conformal}
%invariance. 
Here, their relation to conformal field theory (CFT) provides an important
universal number, the {\it central charge} $c$, that appears in an astonishing array of physical
quantities \cite{Cardyubiquitous}. A given CFT, and
thus any quantum critical points it describes, can be
characterized by this number,
%Moreover, a profound result, Zamolodchikov's
%$c$-theorem, indicates that $c$ cannot increase in
%renormalization-group flows \cite{Zamo}. 
which provides a valuable tool in identifying which if any conformal field
theory describes a given Hamiltonian. 
%Namely, since it appears in
%various physical quantities, it can be measured numerically, and then
%compared with the central charges of the (many) known
%CFTs. 
Traditionally, numerically extracting $c$ for a 1d quantum
Hamiltonian was done by analyzing the finite-size spectrum
\cite{BCN,Affleck}.  This can be difficult: not only is it a
subleading contribution to the ground-state energy, but requires also
determining the Fermi velocity.
%More recently, a more direct method very amenable to numerical
%simulation has been utilized.  
However, it was demonstrated \cite{Holzhey, VidalC} that the central charge can also be extracted 
directly from the ground-state wavefunction by measuring its Renyi
entanglement entropy, $ S_n = 1/(1-n) \ln \big[ {\rm Tr} \rho_A^n
\big], $ where region $A$ is entangled with its complement, region
$B$.  In particular, the scaling of the Renyi entropy at a 1D critical system,
with total length $L$ and length of region $A$ being $x$, obeys \cite{Korepin,Cardy}
\begin{equation}
S_n = \frac{c}{6}\left({1+ \frac{1}{n} }\right) \ln\Big[ \frac{L}{\pi} \sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big) \Big]. \label{1Dcft}
\end{equation}
Thus here $c$ appears as the coefficient of the leading
term.  
Numerical measurement of entanglement entropy have become commonplace and 
very accurate, e.g. in simulations using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG),
making Eq.~\ref{1Dcft} the gold standard for identifying $c$.


In higher dimensional groundstates of condensed matter systems, the scaling behavior of
entanglement entropy is much less well-understood.  Local Hamiltonians
are generally believed to produce ``area-law'' (i.e. boundary) scaling, the subleading corrections
to which may be universal quantities that can be used to identify and characterize
quantum phases and phase transitons.
The most well established of these is the {\it topological entanglement entropy} of a gapped
spin liquid state, that is an universal quantity reflecting the emergent gauge symmetry.
In gapless states, the subleading corrections, although still potentially harbouring universal 
quantities, become more complicated.
In presence of spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, it has been found that Goldstone modes 
produce a bulk logarithmic correction.
Subleading logarithms are also predicted to occur at critical points, the coefficients of which are universal. 
%In higher dimensions, the relationship between entanglement entropy
%and universal quantities is less concrete.  Although conformal
%invariance exists at scale-invariant critical points in the presence
%of translational and rotational symmetry, the breaking of these
%symmetries in physical systems can make the critical points
%non-conformal.  Moreover, even if conformal, precisely which quantity
%in general to identify as a central charge is an open question.
Some speculate that the presence of logarithmic scaling can be used to define an ``effective'' central
charge for non-conformally invariant systems in 2D. % that may contain
%universal physics (or perhaps even the equivalent of the $c$-theorem
%in higher-dimensions \cite{ryu,Myers}).  
%Arguments exist that logarithms similar to Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}) should emerge due to some
%asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance in higher-dimensional
%gapless models \cite{Shredder} (although counter examples are known).  
However, as Calabrese and Cardy caution, basic scaling relationships of
higher-dimensional systems need to be carefully checked before
arguments about asymptotic restoration of conformal invariance are
advanced \cite{EE_CFT}.

In this paper, we study numerically the scaling of the second Renyi entropy in several gapless wavefunctions in 2D \cite{Misguich}.
For a free spinless fermion in the $\pi$-flux phase, we find that the entanglement scaling has a unpredicted shape-dependent piece.
For finite-size systems, this closely mimics the chord length of Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}), although in the infinite-size limit 
it is observed to cross over to a different non-trivial function.
We also examine finite-size scaling of the second Renyi entropy in the gapless N\'eel state, and the nearest-neighbor RVB wavefunction
on the 2D square lattice, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations.
In addition to the subleading logarithm identified in Ref.~\cite{HeisLog},
we observe the emergence of a shape-dependent scaling function that closely mimics the chord-length of 1D CFT on finite-size systems, similar to the case of $\pi$-flux fermions.
Among other consequences, this shape-dependent term will give a non-zero signature in the entanglement quantities designed to look for topological order by Kitaev and Preskill \cite{KP} and Levin and Wen \cite{LW} in gapped wavefunctions.  This implies that a straightforward generalization of the concept of a topological entanglement entropy will not be possible in gapless spin liquid states.

%Since the terms in the Renyi entropy with
%universal behavior are subleading in $d>1$, it has only recently become
%possible to measure them accurately through the development of measurement
%techniques in scalable quantum Monte
%Carlo (QMC) methods \cite{swap,XXZ}.  Simulations employing this advance
%have confirmed the presence of universal subleading corrections to the
%area-law in topologically-ordered systems \cite{isakov}, as well as preliminary
%confirmations of area-law (and subleading logarithms) in the simple
%gapless 2D N\'eel state \cite{HeisLog}. %>>> Misguich should be mentioned too, they've been doing this for a while???.  
%In this paper, we perform a careful
%finite-size scaling analysis of Renyi entropies in a specific
%cornerless geometry in several gapless wavefunctions \cite{Misguich}. 

{\it Fermions with $\pi$-flux---}
%Before presenting the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) analysis of more complicated models, we begin with a more tractable case, a free fermion model.
We begin by considering a tractable case of
free spinless fermions on a square lattice, with $\pi$-flux through each plaquette.  We consider a torus of size $L_x$ by $L_y$, and
measure the entanglement % for two different types of region $A$: a $square$ region $A$ containing four corners, and 
using a cornerless $strip$ region $A$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:torus}) which has no corners and constant boundary length $\ell = 2L_y$.
We denote the width of region $A$ by $x$ and denote $L = \ell/2$.
%, where a square will have dimensions $x$ by $x$ and a strip will be $x$ by $L$ when it is embedded in an $L$ by $L$ system.
Using translation invariance in the $y$-direction, it is possible to simulate large systems.  This system has Dirac points near momentum $k_y=0$ and $k_y=\pi$.

We claim that the entanglement entropy of such a system is given by
\be
S_n \sim {\rm const.}\times L + F(x/L_x,L_y/L_x),
\ee
where the constant is non-universal and the function $F$ is a universal scaling function of the dimensionless ratios.  Note that this result differs
from the result in one dimension, Eq.~(\ref{1Dcft}), in that the lattice scale appears in the first non-universal term but does not appear in the second universal log.  In contrast, the one-dimensional result can be written as a sum of two terms as:
$S_n = \frac{c}{6}\left({ \frac{1}{1+n} }\right) \ln[\sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big)]+\frac{c}{6}\left(\frac{1}{1+n}\right)\ln[\frac{L}{\pi}]$, so that the first term is a universal function of the dimensionless ratio $x/L$, akin to the function $F$ above while the second term involves the lattice scale, as it diverges with $L$.

To illustrate the absence of such an ``additive logarithm" (a logarithmic divergence depending on $L$ divided by lattice scale) in two dimensions, it is helpful to 
consider the two-dimensional entropy as a sum of one-dimensional entropies of systems with different momenta, $k_y$.  Let $C=(c/6)(1+n)^{-1}$.  Then, the $k_y=0$ mode has an additive logarithm $C \log(L)$.  The modes with small $k_y$ have additive logarithms $C \log(k_y^{-1})$.  Summing over $k_y=2\pi n/L_y$, this gives an entropy (in a very crude approximation) $C \big( \log(L)+\sum_{n=1}^{L} \log(L/2 \pi n) \big)=C\log(L) + C\log((L/2\pi)^L/L!)$.  Using Stirlings formula for $L!$, one finds that the terms of order $\log(L)$ cancel.  A similar calculation near $k_y=\pi$ leads to a cancellation of the additive logarithm there.
In contrast to this case, we will find below that such an additive logarithm {\it is} present for the Heisenberg system \cite{HeisLog}.

The entropy of a given $k_y$ mode contains, in addition to the additive logarithmic divergence in $k_y$, a universal scaling function $G(x/L_x,k_y x)$.  At $k_y=0$, we see the chord-length scaling $C \ln\sin\big( \frac{\pi x}{L} \big)$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:dirac}), but for $k_y \neq 0$ and for $k_y x$ large, the chord-length scaling disappears and the entropy becomes roughly flat as a function of $x/L$.  In fact, for $L_y=L_x=L$, the lowest $k_y$ mode has a mass $2 k_y=4\pi/L$, and hence the entropy of that mode is flat for a large range of $x/L$.  As a result, for $L_y=L_x=L$, the entropy of the two dimensional system appears to display chord length scaling over a wide range of $x/L_x$.

{\it Quantum Monte Carlo---}
Using QMC techniques we simulate both the
Heisenberg ground state and the resonating valence bond (RVB)
wavefunction in two dimensions (2D).  The Heisenberg ground state is
projected from a trial state by applying a high power of the
Hamiltonian, via a QMC method operating in the valence bond (VB)
basis \cite{Sandvik}. %The Hamiltonian operators act to reorganize the
%bonds while effectively penalizing states with longer bonds.  
The RVB wavefunction, in contrast, 
is composed of a linear superposition of all possible 
nearest-neighbor valence-bonds \cite{RVB1,RVB2}.  The RVB 
Monte Carlo sampling
algorithm does a random walk through the possible states by creating a
defect at some spatial point and propagating it through the system (thereby
rearranging the nearest-neighbor bonds) until the defect reaches the
initial point and its path forms a closed loop.
If we visualize the Heisenberg ground state in this VB language, then the RVB wavefunction is its largest component, the remainder of the state being equal superpositions with longer bonds decaying with the length of the bonds as $1/r^3$ \cite{Sandvik}.
We consider the same geometry as for the $\pi$-flux fermions above, with $L_x=L_y=L$.

In Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_bow}} we illustrate QMC results for the Renyi entropy in the N\'eel and RVB states on a $24 \times 24$ torus (Fig.~\ref{fig:torus}).  Several features of the entanglement scaling are clear from this plot.  First, note that the curve for the N\'eel state has a significant curvature as a function of $x$.


N\'eel state, first explored in Ref.~\cite{HeisLog}.  In that work, the presence of an area law term $\propto \ell$ was confirmed, as well as a subleading logarithmic term $\propto \ln(\ell)$ (present, surprisingly, even with an absence of corners in the region $A$).  This subleading term was extracted when the width of the region $A$, $x = L/2$, is equivalent to the ``center'' of each curve in Fig.~{\ref{fig:heis_bow}}.  As is apparent, this choice of region $A$ removes the $x$-dependence of each curve.  This can be remedied
by the scaling ansatz
\begin{align}
S_2(L) &= a(L) \ell + b(L) \ln(\ell) \nonumber \\
&+ c(L) \ln \left[{ \sin\left({ \frac{\pi x}{L} }\right) }\right] + d(L) \label{Fit}
\end{align}
{\color{red} which we use to fit {\it all} data individually for each system size $L$. }
% 1.  Do we fit all the data individually with this full function?
% 2.  If so that put "each data set individually" if not then "all data simultaneously"
It is clear in Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}} that this form gives an excellent fit to the data for all $x$ and $L$, providing strong evidence for the presence of the chord length.  We can analyze the fits further by examining the dependence of the coefficients on system size $L$.  Most interestingly, we observe the coefficient of the chord-length increasing with $L$, as illustrated in the inset of Fig.~{\ref{fig:1}}.

We next examine the scaling of the Renyi entropy in the RVB wavefunction, illustrated in Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}.  As apparent in the inset for $L=24$, there exists a more complicated structure to the entropies than in the N\'eel state: the appearance of two branches, an ``upper branch'' when $x$ is odd, and a ``lower branch'' when $x$ is even.  The precise source of the two branches is not known, although simple counting arguments of prototypical valence-bond configurations in the (0,0) topological sector may hint at their existence since the number of valence-bonds crossing from region $A$ to region $B$ alternates strongly with $x$.  Even from this $L=24$ curve there is a clear $x$-dependent curve in each branch: this can be analyzed more closely by examining one branch and attempting fits of the form Eq.~(\ref{Fit}).  In the main plot of Fig.~{\ref{fig:2}}, it is clear that fits to the scaling ansatz for the lower branch are excellent.  Examining the $L$-dependence of the fit coefficients shows that, like in the N\'eel state, the coefficient of the chord length increases with increasing system size.
