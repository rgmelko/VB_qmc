Dear Editor,We are delighted to submit the enclosed manuscript, "Universal large-scale entanglement in two-dimensional gapless systems", for consideration in Physical Review Letters.Using numerical simulations of several wavefunctions in condensed matter physics, we have confirmed for the first time that gapless wavefunctions have a universal shape-dependent scaling function, \gamma.  This function is subleading to the usual "area-law" and is absent in conventional or topological gapped states.  The observation of a non-zero shape-dependent term in the wavefunctions studied in this paper strongly suggests that a universal \gamma might be a general feature of entanglement entropy scaling in gapless states.  This fact has profound consequences in several disparate fields of physics, including, but not limited to, quantum information, topological phases, and conformally invariant systems in condensed matter physics.  We hope that the editors and referees share our excitement.Sincerely, H. Ju, A. Kallin, P. Fendley, M. Hastings, and R. Melko
