Dear Editor

We are delighted to submit the enclosed manuscript, "Universal large-scale entanglement in two-dimensional gapless systems", for consideration in Physical Review Letters.

Using numerical simulations of several condensed-matter systems, we have shown for the first time that gapless wavefunctions have a universal shape-dependent scaling function.  This shape-dependent function, galled \gamma, subleading to the usual "area-law", is not present in conventional gapped states in condensed-matter, or gapped topological spin liquid phases.
