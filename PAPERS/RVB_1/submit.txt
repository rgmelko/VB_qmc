Dear Editor

We are delighted to submit the enclosed manuscript, "Universal large-scale entanglement in two-dimensional gapless systems", for consideration in Physical Review Letters.

Using numerical simulations of several condensed-matter systems, we have shown for the first time that gapless wavefunctions have a universal shape-dependent scaling function.  This shape-dependent function, galled \gamma, subleading to the usual "area-law", is not present in conventional gapped states in condensed-matter, or gapped topological spin liquid phases.  

The observation of a non-zero shape-dependent term in the very different types of wavefunctions studied in this paper strongly suggest that a universal \gamma might be a general feature of entanglement entropy scaling in gapless wavefunction.  This fact has profound consequences in several disparate fields of physics, including quantum information, topological phases, spin liquids, conformal field theory in condensed matter systems, and others.  We hope that the editors and referees share our excitement.

Sincerely, 
H. Ju, A. Kallin, P. Fendley, M. Hastings, and R. Melko
