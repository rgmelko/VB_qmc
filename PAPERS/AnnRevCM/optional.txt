Glossary
--------

lattice model: 
a Hamiltonian of bosons, fermions and/or spins defined on a spatial
lattice, typically corresponding to or inspired by the degrees of freedom of a solid. 
Such models can now some times also be directly realized in ultracold-atom systems 
in optical lattices.

field theoretic description: 
A continuum description of a lattice model which captures certain asymptotic 
(low-energy, long-distance, etc) features of the lattice model exactly.

unbiased numerical method: 
A numerical method in which quantitative calculations of observables are possible for 
a microscopic model of finite size without invoking any approximation or asymptotic 
condition, with the exception of statistical errors (in Monte Carlo based methods) 
for which the numerical errors are purely statistical, can be estimated quantitatively,
and reduced to an arbitrary low level with increasing computation time.


Acronyms
--------

BFG : Balents-Fisher-Girvin

QMC : quantum Monte Carlo

DQC : deconfined quantum-critical

VBL : valence-bond liquid

VBS : valence-bond solid

QDM : quantum dimer model

QSL : quantum spin liquid


Summary points
--------------

- Thanks to algorithmic advances during the past two decades, QMC simulations have reached the point 
  where the asymptotic low-energy limit can truly be reached and one can make direct connections with 
  effective quantum field theories.

- QMC is the only numerical method that can study model Hamiltonians in two and higher dimensions in 
  computational time that scales polynomially with system size without any systematical errors.

- A number of "designer Hamiltonians" have been studied that exhibit highly non-trivial non-magnetic
  states of interacting quantum spin systems, including "deconfined" quantum-critical points and associated
  valence-bond solid states with emergent U(1) gauge fields, as well as Z2 quantum spin liquids.

- Generalizations of standard SU(2) quantum spins to SU(N) offer opportunities to test field-theories in
  the large-N limit; such a test of the theory of deconfined quantum-critical points shows good agreement
  between simulations and analytic theory.

- Studies of SU(N) models in bilayer geometry show explicitly the role of Berry phases at quantum phase
  transitions.

Future Issues
-------------

- Carry out QMC calculations for larger lattices for the SU(N) models, to reduce
  the error bars on the extracted critical exponents.

- Study effects of disorder (random couplings, dilution) and isolated impurities
  on the ground states and phase transitions discussed.

- Construct SU(N) designer Hamiltonians with Z2 spin-liquid ground states; may have to
  be done in conjunction with QMC algorithm in a non-trivial basis allowing non-Marshall
  sign structure of the ground state wave function.
