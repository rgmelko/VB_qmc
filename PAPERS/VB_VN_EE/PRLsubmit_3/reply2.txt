Dear Editor,

We are delighted to hear that Referee B recommends this paper for publication "without hesitation", and Referee C "would lean in the direction of publication".

Below are responses to specific referee comments, and details of changes to the manuscript. 

Thank you,
Ann Kallin, Ivan Gonzalez, Matthew Hastings, and Roger Melko

We have included a new reference [11] pointing to two new plots (which
will be available on EPAPS) that illustrate the scaling of entropy with
the number of DMRG states kept.  The first EPAPS figure shows the error in
von Neumann entropies at x=2N^2 for ladders of two different sizes (4-leg
with length 100, and 5-leg with length 4N) on a logarithmic scale plotted
against number of DMRG states kept, m.  Each value of the entropy is
calculated from an independent program run that is converged to keep m
DMRG states per block at the end of the run.  The error corresponding to a
given m is defined as the difference between the entropy obtained from the
run with the largest value of m (1200 for 5-legs and 800 for 4-legs) and
that obtained from the run with this particular m. As this method requires
a set of independent runs, we use an alternative way to analyze the DMRG
convergence for the thickest ladders.  The second EPAPS figure shows the
error in the von Neumann entropy as well as the DMRG truncation error at
x=2N^2 on a 7-leg ladder with 4N sites per leg.  In this case we use the
data from a single program run that is converged to keep a large number of
DMRG states per block (1800).  We save all the eigenvalues of the last
density matrix (DM) diagonalization and use the largest m eigenvalues to
calculate the entropy as $S^{vN}_{m}=\sum^{m}_{i=0}p_{i}ln p_{i}$, with
$p{i}=\lambda_{i}/Z$ and $Z=\sum^{m}_{i=0}\lambda_{i}$, $\lambda_{i}$
being the i-th largest eigenvalue of the DM diagonalization. The error
correspoding to a given m is defined as the difference between the entropy
obtained with all of the DM eigenvalues (1800x2=3600) and that obtained
for this particular m. As shown in the EPAPS plots truncation errors from
finite m are smaller than our estimate of finite size corrections, which
can be extracted from the difference in S/N for N=7 and N=6. We have also
removed the sentence on the truncated weight from the text, as suggested
by the referee.

>- While in the abstract the authors carefully write "... are

>as, e.g., on 2N-leg ladders, there is a gap and no Neel state
>(which is reached by sending L to infinity). More appropriately,

We agree, and have changed the statement along the lines suggested:
"Clearly, for $S^{ \rm vN}$  our data suggest for $N$-leg ladders that 
the area law is valid in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit (i.e.~the Neel state) as well,..."

>- Discussion of "Bond-length distribution": I stumbled over the

Yes, it is correct that we meant that the sums are infinite once the system size is taken to infinity.  We have replaced "unnormalized" with "unnormalizable" to avoid confusion.

We believe this point has been addressed in Referee B's second point, and in response we have changed the wording of the statement "Clearly, for S^vN the area law is obeyed in the Neel ground state." to 
"Clearly, for $S^{ \rm vN}$  our data suggest for $N$-leg ladders that 
the area law is valid in the $N \rightarrow \infty$ limit (i.e.~the Neel state) as well,..."
