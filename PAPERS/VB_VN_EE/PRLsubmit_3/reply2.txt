Dear Editor,

We are delighted to hear that Referee B recommends this paper for publication "without hesitation", and Referee C "would lean in the direction of publication".

Below are responses to specific referee comments, and details of changes to the manuscript. 

Thank you,
Ann Kallin, Ivan Gonzalez, Matthew Hastings, and Roger Melko

We have included two plots illustrating the scaling of entropy with the number of DMRG states kept. (***NAME OF PLOT 1***) shows the the von Neumann entropies at x=2N^2 for ladders of two different sizes (4-leg with length 100, and 5-leg with length 4N) plotted against number of DMRG states kept on a logarithmic scale.
The second figure, (***NAME OF PLOT 2***), looks at convergence of the entropy at x=2N^2 on a 7-leg ladder with 4N sites per leg.  It shows the difference between the exact entropy value (taken as the value obtained by keeping 1800 DMRG states) and the value obtained by keeping the largest m states, as well as the truncation error.
We have also removed the sentence on the truncated weight from the text. (*** we haven't actually done this yet ***)

>- While in the abstract the authors carefully write "... are
>sufficient to indicate ..." they say, later on: "Clearly, for S^vN
>the area law is obeyed in the Neel ground state." This is misleading
>as, e.g., on 2N-leg ladders, there is a gap and no Neel state
>(which is reached by sending L to infinity). More appropriately,
>the authors could rephrase this as: "Clearly, for S^vN our data
>suggest for N-leg ladders that the area law is valid in the N->
>infinity limit as well, ie, in the Neel state".

We have changed the statement "Clearly, for S^vN the area law is obeyed in the Neel ground state." to "Clearly, for S^vN our data suggest for N-leg ladders that the area law is valid in the N-> infinity limit as well, ie, in the Neel state." (*** haven't done this yet***)

>- Discussion of "Bond-length distribution": I stumbled over the
>word "unnormalized". Do the authors mean that for p<2, the sums
>are infinite, and thus the norm of P(x,y) does not exist? This is
>a semantic question.

Yes, it is correct that we meant that the sums are infinite once the system size is taken to infinity.  We have replaced "unnormalized" with "unnormalizable" to avoid confusion. (*** also haven't done this ***)

>The only additional point I might raise is the issue of dimensional

We believe this point has been addressed in Referee B's second point, and in response we have changed the wording of the statement "Clearly, for S^vN the area law is obeyed in the Neel ground state." to "Clearly, for S^vN our data suggest for N-leg ladders that the area law is valid in the N-> infinity limit as well, ie, in the Neel state." (*** haven't done this yet***)
