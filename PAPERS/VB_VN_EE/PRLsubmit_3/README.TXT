Title:  Valence bond and von Neumann entanglement entropy in 
        Heisenberg ladders


DEPOSIT INFORMATION
Description:
            README.TXT:  This text file contains information about the
                included EPAPS material.
                   
            mfig1.eps:  This figure shows the difference between the 
                exact von Neumann entropy (taken as the value obtained
                by keeping 800 DMRG states for the 4-leg case and 1200 
                states for the 5-leg case) and the von Neumann entropy 
                obtained by keeping m DMRG states.  The entropy values 
                are taken at x=2N^2, and data is shown for a 4-leg 
                ladder with length 100 and a 5-leg ladder with length 
                4N (=20).

            mfig2.eps: This figure looks at convergence of the entropy 
                at x=2N^2 on a 7-leg ladder with 4N sites per leg.  
                It shows the difference between the exact entropy 
                value (taken as the value obtained by keeping 1800 
                DMRG states) and the value obtained by keeping the 
                largest m states, as well as the truncation error.
                In this case the data for m<1800 may not necessarily
                be converged.
