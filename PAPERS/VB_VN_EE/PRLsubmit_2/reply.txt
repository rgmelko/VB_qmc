We have resubmitted our manuscript and made changes in response to referee criticisms.

We are delighted that Referee B gives very strong support for publication of our paper in PRL:
"this work contributes to questions of fundamental importance to the strongly correlated electrons and quantum information theory communities, and should therefore be considered for publication in the Physical Review Letters."
We believe that Referee B has given very careful thought with regard to our manuscript, as is apparent in his/her thorough understanding of the material and careful criticism.   We would like to take the opportunity to respond to this referee's remarks:

>  1) The authors mostly study ladders with L=100 sites. How do the
>  results for the scaling of the van Neumann entropy presented in
>  Fig 3 depend on L?

This is a good question, and we have addressed it in the revised version of the manuscript.  First, we note that our results for Fig 3 presented in the first version of the paper represent a very substantial use of high-performance computing resources (over 12 years of CPU time for the QMC, and memory usage nearing 8Gb for the DMRG) and therefore it is not reasonable to go to larger L: however, it is possible to use smaller L.  After careful thought, we have decided to re-examine the scaling of the data using an L that changes with the number of rungs N, specifically L=4*N, so that we approach 2D in a different "order of limits" (taking L->infinity and N->infinity together).  The results are very good, as reported in our revised figure 3, where we see essentially the exact same trends in behavior (area law with DMRG, multiplicative log with VB QMC).  Furthermore, we were able to converge a ladder with larger N in this limit (N=7), which adds more weight to our conclusion that the von Neumann entropy is indeed scaling to a robust area law in the 2D limit.  We thank the referee for this suggestion, which we feel leads to an increase in the strength of our conclusions.

We have indeed examined all of the other bipartitions possible with the DMRG: namely cuts across all legs that are not "cleanly" across a rung, for example like illustrated in figure 2.  We note that the DMRG is constrained to geometries such as this by the sweeping algorithm.  However, the scaling trends that we observe when examining these other bipartitions is essentially the same as with the bipartition that we have reported - hence we chose not to include it in order to non clutter our main results.  We have however added the following note to the manuscript:
"We note that other choices of bipartition compatible with the DMRG sweeping give similar results for the area law in S^vN"

We note that in the VB QMC, there is no constraint on the choice of bipartition.  However, previous practitioners (Ref. 7 and 8) have found the same multiplicative log correction in the VB entropy using a square bipartition in 2D.  We feel that this is the most important result in regard to this question.

We agree, but make the note that the statistical analysis of the QMC data is much more difficult in this case compared to the case of PBC, because of the influence of the boundaries.  What happens is that the statistical confidence in the fit to the central charge form gets systematically worse as points are removed from the boundary, so that by the time one is out of the region of influence of the boundary, the uncertainty in calculating c is very large.  We have however made an attempt to extrapolate our OBC data for the system sizes available, in the case where half of the data is removed from the boundary regions, as an example.  The result, c=0.85, is reported in the revised manuscript.

We used up to 2000 states in the DMRG calculations for the largest lattice sizes...  (Ivan do you have this info?  I can't remember who ran these).

We have attempted to improve this figure along the lines suggested.

We unfortunately feel that the "adverse" critique of referee A is sufficiently incorrect as to shed doubt on his suitability as a reviewer, reflecting some underlying aversion to the field or other bias.  First, to address a few points:

1) The referee twice refers to the valence-bond QMC calculation as occurring on a "toy model":

> They conclude that the behavior derived from the entropy
> on the RVB model, a kind of "toy model", could not be valid for
> the Heisenberg model 
  and
> I also think that the contribution of this
> manuscript to that program is not important since it is essentially
> a criticism to an early proposed "toy model" which I doubt was a
> serious contribution to this field.

This is a serious mis-understanding.  The VB QMC calculation is on the Heisenberg model itself - the same strongly-interacting quantum spin model as the DMRG considers.  The main difference is that the model is projected onto two different bases: the Sz basis in the DMRG, and the valence-bond basis in the QMC.  The approaches to solving this model in each case is also different - one a renormalization scheme and one a stochastic monte carlo - but in both cases the results for thermodynamic estimators are obtained essentially without bias, and agree with each other completely.  The referee seems to miss the main point of the paper in that we are comparing two different definitions of entanglement entropy calculated in the same model, not two different models.

2) In the case that point is taken to be semantical, we also reject the notion that the VB entanglement entropy was not a serious contribution to the field.  In contrast, it represents the first attempt to measure non-trivial entanglement properties in unbiased 2D simulations, and there have been many papers citing it since the first publications of reference 7 and 8.  Further, even before the idea of the valence bond entropy, bond length distributions are well studied, dating back to the early days of RVB.

3) Contrary to the referee's criticism , this is not just a "methodological" paper - we present some new and important physics.  In particular, this is the *first ever* demonstration of area law behavior for a non-trivial interacting system.  People have calculated entanglement entropy for free fermions and bosons, and there are some toy Hamiltonian with exact PEPS ground states where it has been calculated, but no one has ever before shown the area law for an interesting interacting model such as this. 

------------------------------------------

In conclusion, we assert (in agreement with Referee B) that our manuscript sufficiently satisfies PRL's criterion of "
broad interest".  In particular, in accordance with PRL's own "re-invigorated standards, we have substantially advanced the field of calculating von Neumann entropys in 2D, by demonstrating the feasibility of using DMRG simulations on multi-leg ladders.  We believe that this will open a new area of research, particularly in the measurement of area law corrections to entanglement entropy as indicators of exotic phases in other models (such as those with a spinon Fermi surface, as mentioned).  We have also solved the critical outstanding problem of the adherence of the S=1/2 heisenberg model to the area law, and demonstrated that previous claims to the contrary were the result of an artifact of the measurement procedure, the VB entanglement entropy.

In light of this, we respectfully ask that the editor disregard Referee A's report, due to what we feel are glaring indicators of misunderstanding and/or bias.  We hope that the strength of Referee B's report would be sufficient to warrant acceptance to PRL: if the editor however chooses to send the manuscript for further review, we request that he choose a third referee in lieu of Referee A.
